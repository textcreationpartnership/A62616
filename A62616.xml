            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMONG many other things, which may juſtly recommend the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of mankind, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick goodneſs of it is moſt apt to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59936:4"/>make impreſſion upon the Minds of ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and conſiderate men. The Miracles of it are the great external evidence and confirmation of its truth and Divinity; but the morality of its doctrines and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, ſo agreeable to the beſt reaſon and wiſeſt apprehenſions of mankind, ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably fitted for the perfecting of our natures and the ſweetning of the ſpirits and tempers of men, ſo friendly to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Society and every way ſo well cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for the peace and order of the World. Theſe are the things which our Religion glories in as her crown and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. <hi>Miracles</hi> are apt to awaken and aſtoniſh, and by a ſenſible and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering evidence to bear down the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of Infidelity; but there are ſecret charms in <hi>goodneſs</hi> which take faſt hold of the hearts of men and do inſenſibly, but effectually, command our love and eſteem.</p>
            <p>And ſurely nothing can be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the occaſion of this Day, than a Diſcourſe upon this Argument; which ſo directly tends to correct that unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſpirit, and miſtaken zeal, which hath been the cauſe of all our troubles and confuſions, and had ſo powerfull an influence upon that horrid Tragedy
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59936:4"/>which was deſigned, now near upon four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years ago, to have been acted as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Day.</p>
            <p>And that we may the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the reaſon of our Saviour's reproof here in the Text, it will be requiſite to conſider the occaſion of this hot and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious zeal which appeared in ſome of his Diſciples. And that was this; Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was going from <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and being to paſs through a Village of <hi>Samaria</hi> he ſent meſſengers before him to prepare entertainment for him; but the People of that Place would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, becauſe he was going to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:</hi> the Reaſon whereof was, the <hi>difference of Religion</hi> which then was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Samaritans.</hi> Of which I ſhall give you this brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Samaritans</hi> were originally that Colony of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> which we find in the Book of <hi>Kings</hi> was, upon the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of the Ten Tribes, planted in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> by <hi>Salmanaſſar.</hi> They were Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and worſhipped their own Idols, till they were ſo infeſted with Lions, that for the redreſs of this miſchief they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be inſtructed in the worſhip of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hoping by this means to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59936:5"/>appeaſe the anger of the God of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and then they worſhipped the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> together with their own Idols; for ſo it is ſaid in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Kings,</hi> That <hi>they ſeared the Lord, and ſerved their own Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was rebuilt, all the <hi>Jews</hi> were obliged by a ſolemn Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to put away their <hi>Heathen</hi> Wives. It happened that <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſt, had married the Daughter of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat</hi> the <hi>Samaritan;</hi> and being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to put away his Wife, <hi>Sanballat</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the <hi>Samaritans</hi> to build a Temple upon Mount <hi>Gerizim</hi> near the City of <hi>Samaria,</hi> in oppoſition to the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and made <hi>Manaſſes</hi> his Son-in-law, Prieſt there.</p>
            <p>Upon the building of this new Temple there aroſe a great feud between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans,</hi> which in proceſs of time grew to ſo violent a hatred that they would not ſo much as ſhew common civility to one another. And this was the reaſon why the <hi>Samaritans</hi> would not receive our Saviour in his journey, becauſe they perceived he was going to worſhip at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59936:5"/>
            <p>At this uncivil uſage of our Saviour, <hi>two</hi> of his Diſciples, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently take fire, and out of a well-meaning zeal for the honour of their Maſter, and of the true God, and of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the true place of his worſhip, they are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately for diſpatching out of the way theſe Enemies of God, and Chriſt, and the true Religion; theſe <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> for ſo they called one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And to this end they deſire our Saviour to give them power to <hi>call for fire from Heaven to conſume them,</hi> as <hi>Elias</hi> had done in a like caſe, and that too not far from <hi>Samaria;</hi> and it is not improbable that their being ſo near the place where <hi>Elias</hi> had done the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, might prompt them to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour ſeeing them in this heat notwithſtanding all the reaſons they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for their paſſion, and for all they ſheltered themſelves under the great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Elias,</hi> doth very calmly but ſeverely reprove this temper of theirs, <hi>Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of: for the Son of Man is not come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerves, that theſe two excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sentences are leſt out in a <hi>Manuſcript</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59936:6"/>that is in <hi>England.</hi> I cannot tell what <hi>Manuſcript</hi> he refers to, but if it were a Copy written out in the height of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, no wonder if ſome zealous Tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber offended at this paſſage, ſtruck it out of the Goſpel, being confident our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our would not ſay any thing, that was ſo directly contrary to the current Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and practice of thoſe times. But thanks be to God, this admirable <hi>Saying</hi> is ſtill preſerv'd, and can never be made uſe of upon a fitter occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of: That is,</hi> Ye own your ſelves to be my Diſciples, but do you conſider what ſpirit now acts and governs you; Not <hi>that</hi> ſurely which my Doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to mould and faſhion you into, which is not a furious and perſecuting and deſtructive ſpirit, but mild and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and ſaving; tender of the lives and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of men, even of thoſe who are our greateſt Enemies: You ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, That you are not now under the rough and ſowr Diſpenſation of the Law, but the calm and peaceable Inſtitution of the Goſpel; to which the ſpirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> though he was a very good man in his time, would be altogether unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. God p rmitted it then, under that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59936:6"/>imperfect way of Religion, but now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel it would be intolerable: For that deſigns univerſal love, and peace, and good-will: and now no difference of Religion, no pretence of zeal for God and Chriſt can warrant and juſtifie this paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and fierce, this vindictive and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating ſpirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the Son of Man is not come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them.</hi> He ſays in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed elſewhere, that he <hi>was not come to ſend Peace, but a Sword;</hi> which we are not to underſtand of the natural tendency of his Religion, but of the accidental e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and effect of it, through the malice and perverſeneſs of men: But here he ſpeaks of the proper intention and deſign of his coming: <hi>He</hi> came not to kill and deſtroy, but <hi>for the healing of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> for the ſalvation and redemption of Mankind, not onely <hi>from the wrath to come,</hi> but from a great part of the evils and miſeries of this life: <hi>He</hi> came to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance all fierceneſs and rage and cruelty in men, one towards another; to reſtrain and ſubdue that furious and unpeaceable Spirit, which is ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the world, and the cauſe of ſo many miſchiefs and diſorders in it: And to introduce a Religion which conſults
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59936:7"/>not only the eternal Salvation of mens ſouls, but their temporal peace and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, their comfort and happineſs in this world.</p>
            <p>The <hi>words</hi> thus explained contain this Obſervation, <hi>That a revengeful and cruel and deſtructive Spirit, is directly contrary to the deſign and temper of the Goſpel, and not to be excuſed upon any pretence of zeal for God and Religion.</hi>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall ſhew <hi>the oppoſition of this ſpirit to the true Spirit and deſign of the Chriſtian Religion:</hi> That it is directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the main and fundamental <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> of the Goſpel, and to the great <hi>Paterns</hi> and Examples of our Religion,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59936:7"/>our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. This ſpirit which our Saviour here reproves in his Diſciples, is directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the main and fundamental <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> of the Goſpel; which command us to <hi>love one another,</hi> and <hi>to love all men,</hi> even our very <hi>enemies;</hi> and are ſo far from permitting us to perſecute thoſe who hate us, that they forbid us to hate thoſe who perſecute us: They require us to be <hi>merciful as our Father which is in Heaven is merciful;</hi> to be <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>tender-hearted, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel againſt any, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven us:</hi> And <hi>to put on as the elect of God, bowels of mercy, meekneſs and long-ſuffering,</hi> and to <hi>follow peace with all men,</hi> and to <hi>ſhew all meekneſs to all men;</hi> And particulary the Paſtors and Governors of the Church are eſpecially charged to be of this temper, <hi>The ſervant of the Lord muſt not strive, but be gentle unto all men; apt to teach, in meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if peradventure God will give them repentance to the acknowledgment of the truth.</hi> To all which <hi>Precepts,</hi> and many more that I might reckon up, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59936:8"/>can be more plainly oppoſite than inhumane Cruelties and Perſecutions, treacheroos Conſpiracies and bloody Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres, a barbarous Inquiſition, and a <hi>holy League</hi> to extirpate all that differ from us. And inſtead of <hi>inſtructing in meekneſs thoſe that oppoſe themſelves</hi> to convert men with fire and faggot, and to teach them as <hi>Gideon</hi> did the <hi>men of Succoth with briars and thorns;</hi> and inſtead of waiting for their repentance, and endeavouring to recover them out of the ſnare of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to put them quick into his hands, and to diſpatch them to Hell as faſt as is poſſible. If the precepts of Chriſtianity can be contradicted, ſurely it cannot be done more groſly and palpably than by ſuch practiſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This ſpirit is likewiſe directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the great <hi>Paterns</hi> and Examples of our Religion, <hi>our Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians.</hi> It was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of our <hi>Saviour</hi> that he ſhould be <hi>the Prince of peace,</hi> and ſhould make it one of his great buſineſſes upon earth, to make peace in heaven and earth, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile men to God and to one another, to take up all thoſe feuds and to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh all thoſe animoſities that were in the world; to bring to agreement and a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59936:8"/>peaceable demeanour one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe that were moſt diſtant in their tempers and intereſts, to <hi>make the lamb and the wolf lie down together, that there might be no more deſtroying nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring in all Goll's holy mountain; that is,</hi> that <hi>that</hi> cruel and deſtructive ſpirit which prevailed before in the world ſhould then be baniſhed out of all Chriſtian ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties.</p>
            <p>And in conformity to theſe predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when our Saviour was born into the world the Angels ſang that heavenly <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them, Glory to God in the higheſt, peace on earth, and good will among men.</hi> And when he appeared in the world his whole life and carriage was gentle and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, full of meekneſs and charity. His great buſineſs was to be beneficial to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt; <hi>he went about doing good,</hi> to the bodies and to the ſouls of men: his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were not deſtructive to mankind, but healing and charitable. He could, if he had pleaſed, by his miraculous power have confounded his enemies, and have thundred out death and deſtruction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Infidel world, as his pretended <hi>Vicar</hi> hath ſince done againſt Hereticks. But intending that his Religion ſhould be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59936:9"/>propagated in human ways, and that Men ſhould be drawn to the profeſſion of it by the <hi>bands of love</hi> and the <hi>cords of a man,</hi> by the gentle and peaceable methods of Reaſon and perſwaſion; he gave no example of a furious zeal and religious rage againſt thoſe who deſpiſed his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. It was propounded to men for their great advantage, and they rejected it at their utmoſt peril. It ſeemed good to the Author of this inſtitution to compell no man to it by temporal puniſhments. When he went about making proſelytes he offered violence to no man, only ſaid, <hi>If any man will be my diſciple, If any man will come after me.</hi> And when his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were leaving him he does not ſet up an Inquiſition to torture and puniſh them for their defection from the faith, only ſays, <hi>Will ye alſo go away?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in imitation of this bleſſed Patern the Chriſtian Church continued to ſpeak and act for ſeveral Ages. And this was the language of the holy Fathers, <hi>Lex nova non ſe vindicat ultore gladio,</hi> the Chriſtian Law doth not avenge it ſelf by the ſword. This was then the ſtyle of Councils, <hi>Nemini ad credendum vim inferre,</hi> to offer violence to no man to compell him to the Faith. I proceed in the</p>

               <hi>Second</hi> place, to ſhew the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſtifiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this ſpirit upon any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of zeal for God and Religion.</hi> No caſe can be put with Circumſtances of greater advantage and more likely to juſtify this ſpirit and temper, than the caſe here in the Text. Thoſe againſt whom the Diſciples would have <hi>called for fire from heaven,</hi> were Hereticks and Schiſmaticks from the true Church; they had affronted our Saviour himſelf in his own perſon; the honour of God, and of that Religion which he had ſet up in the World, and of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which he had appointed for the place of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip were all concerned in this caſe: ſo that if ever it were warrantable to put on this fierce and furious zeal, here was a caſe that ſeemed to require it: But even in theſe circumſtances our Saviour thinks fit to rebuke and diſcountenance this ſpirit, <hi>Ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of.</hi> And he gives ſuch a reaſon as ought in all differences of Religion, how wide ſoever they be, to deter men from this temper, <hi>For the Son of man is not come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them;</hi> that is, this Spirit is utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the great deſign of Chriſtian
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59936:10"/>Religion, and the end of our Saviour's coming into the world.</p>
            <p>And now, what hath the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to plead for her cruelty to men for the cauſe of Religion, which the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples might not much better have pleaded for themſelves in their caſe? what hath ſhe to ſay againſt thoſe who are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of her cruelty and perſecution, which would not have held againſt the <hi>Samaritans?</hi> Does ſhe practice theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities out of a zeal for truth, and for the honour of God, and Chriſt, and the true Religion? Why, upon theſe very accounts it was, that the Diſciples would have called for <hi>fire from Heaven</hi> to have deſtroyed the <hi>Samaritans.</hi> Is the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> perſwaded that thoſe whom ſhe perſecutes are Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, and that no puniſhment can be too great for ſuch offenders? So the Diſciples were perſwaded of the <hi>Samaritans;</hi> and upon much better grounds: Only the Diſciples had ſome excuſe in their caſe, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not; and that was Ignorance: And this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy our Saviour makes for them, <hi>ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of:</hi> They had been bred up in the Jewiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which gave ſome indulgence to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59936:10"/>this kind of temper, and they were able to cite a great Example for themſelves; beſides, they were then but learners and not throughly inſtructed in the Chriſtian Doctrine. But in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whatever the caſe of particular perſons may be, as to the whole Church and the Governing part of it, this ignorance is wilful and affected, and therefore inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable. For the Chriſtian Religion, which they profeſs to embrace, does as plainly teach the contrary as it does any other matter whatſoever: and it is not more evident in the new Teſtament that Chriſt died for ſinners, than that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould not kill one another for the misbelief of any Article of <hi>revealed</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; much leſs for the disbelief of ſuch Articles as are <hi>invented</hi> by men, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as the Doctrines of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>You have heard what kind of <hi>Spirit</hi> it is, which our Saviour here reproves in his Diſciples. It was a furious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive <hi>Spirit,</hi> contrary to Chriſtian charity and goodneſs. But yet this may be ſaid in mitigation of their fault, that they themſelves offered no violence to their enemies: They left it to God, and no doubt would have been very glad that he would have manifeſted his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59936:11"/>upon them, by ſending down <hi>fire from Heaven</hi> to have conſumed them.</p>
            <p>But there is a much worſe <hi>Spirit</hi> than this in the world, which is not only contrary to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Principles of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> and even to <hi>Humanity</hi> it ſelf: Which by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood and perfidiouſneſs, by ſecret plots and conſpiracies, or by open ſedition and rebellion, by an Inquiſition or Maſſacre, by depoſing and killing Kings, by fire and ſword, by the ruine of their Country, and betraying it into the hands of Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and in a word, by diſſolving all the bonds of humane Society, and ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the peace and order of the World, <hi>that is,</hi> by all the wicked ways imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble doth incite men to promote and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their Religion. As if all the world were made for <hi>them,</hi> and there were not only no other Chriſtians, but no other Men beſides themſelves; as <hi>Babylon</hi> of old proudly vaunted, <hi>I am, and there is none beſides me:</hi> And as if the God, whom the Chriſtians worſhip, were not <hi>the God of order but of confuſion;</hi> as if he whom we call <hi>the Father of mercies,</hi> were delighted with cruelty, and could not have a more pleaſing ſacrifice offered to him than a Maſſacre, nor put a greater
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59936:11"/>honour upon his Prieſts than to make them Judges of an Inquiſition, <hi>that is,</hi> the Inventors and decreers of torments for men more righteous and innocent than themſelves.</p>
            <p>Thus to miſrepreſent God and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to deveſt them of all their Majeſty and Glory. For if that of <hi>Seneca</hi> be true, that <hi>ſine bonitate nulla majeſtas, without Goodneſs there can be no ſuch thing as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> then to ſeparate <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> from God, <hi>compaſſion</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> from Religion, is to make the <hi>two</hi> beſt things in the world, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> good for nothing.</p>
            <p>How much righter apprehenſions had the <hi>Heathen</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> which they looked upon as ſo benign and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to mankind, that (as <hi>Tully</hi> admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſays) <hi>Dii immortales ad uſum homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num fabrefacti penè videantur, The nature of the immortal Gods may almost ſeem to be exactly framed for the benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of men.</hi> And as for <hi>Religion,</hi> they always ſpake of it as the great band of humane Society, and the foundation of truth, and fidelity, and juſtice among men. But when Religion once comes to ſupplant moral Righteouſneſs, and to teach men the abſurdeſt things in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59936:12"/>world, <hi>to lye for the truth, and to kill men for God's ſake:</hi> when it ſerves to no other purpoſe, but to be a bond of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, to inflame the tempers of men to a greater fierceneſs, and to ſet a keener edge upon their ſpirits, and to make them <hi>ten times more the children of wrath</hi> and Cruelty <hi>than they were by nature,</hi> then ſurely it loſes its nature and ceaſes to be <hi>Religion:</hi> For let any man ſay worſe of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Infidelity,</hi> if he can. And, for God's ſake, what is Religion good for, but to reform the manners and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of men, to reſtrain humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from violence and cruelty, from falſhood and treachery, from Sedition and Rebellion? Better it were there were no <hi>revealed</hi> Religion, and that humane nature were left to the conduct of its own principles and inclinations, which are much more mild and merciful, much more for the peace and happineſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society; than to be acted by a Religion that inſpires men with ſo wild a fury, and prompts them to commit ſuch outrages; and is continually ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting Government, and undermining the welfare of mankind; in ſhort, ſuch a Religion as teaches men to propagate and advance it ſelf by <hi>means</hi> ſo evidently
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59936:12"/>contrary to the very <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of all Religion.</p>
            <p>And this, if it be well conſidered, will appear to be a very convincing way of reaſoning, by ſhewing the laſt reſult and conſequence of ſuch Principles, and of ſuch a Train of Propoſitions, to be a moſt groſs and palpable abſurdity. <hi>For example,</hi> We will at preſent admit <hi>Popery</hi> to be the true Religion, and their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>extirpating Hereticks,</hi> of the lawfulneſs of <hi>depoſing Kings,</hi> and ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Government by all the cruel and wicked ways that can be thought of, to be, as in truth they are, the Doctrines of this Religion: In this Caſe, I would not trouble my ſelf to debate particulars; but if in the groſs, and upon the whole matter it be evident that ſuch a Religion as this is as bad or worſe than Infidelity and no Religion, this is conviction enough to a wiſe man, and as good as a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that this is not the true Religion, and that it cannot be from God.</p>
            <p>How much better Teachers of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were the old <hi>Heathen Philoſophers?</hi> In all whoſe Books and Writings there is not one Principle to be found of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery or Rebellion; nothing that gives the leaſt countenance to an <hi>Aſſociation</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59936:13"/>or a Maſſacre, to the betraying of ones Native Country, or the cutting of his Neighbours throat for difference in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I ſpeak it with grief and ſhame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the credit of our common Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſomewhat concerned in it, that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naetius</hi> and <hi>Antipater</hi> and <hi>Diogenes</hi> the <hi>Stoick, Tully</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> were much honeſter and more Chriſtian <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> than the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are, or the generality of the <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> of any other <hi>Order,</hi> that I know of, in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I come now in the</p>

               <hi>Third</hi> and laſt place, to make ſome <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let not Religion ſuffer for thoſe faults and miſcarriages which really pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the ignorance of Religion, and from the want of it. That under colour and pretence of Religion, very bad things are done, is no argument that Religion it ſelf is not good: Becauſe the beſt things are liable to be perverted and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed to very ill purpoſes, nay <hi>the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of them is commonly the worſt;</hi> as, they ſay, the richeſt and nobleſt Wines make the ſharpeſt Vinegar. <hi>If the light that is in you,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>be

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us beware of that <hi>Church</hi> which countenanceth this <hi>unchriſtian ſpirit</hi> here condemned by our Saviour; and which teaches ſuch <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and warrants ſuch <hi>Practices</hi> as are conſonant thereto. You all know, without my ſaying ſo, that I mean the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> in which are taught ſuch <hi>Doctrines</hi> as theſe, That He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, <hi>that is,</hi> all who differ from them in matters of Faith, are to be extirpated by fire and ſword; which was decreed in the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fourth Lateran</hi> Councils, where all Chriſtians are ſtrictly charged to endeavour this to the uttermoſt of their power, <hi>Sicut reputari cupiunt &amp; haberi fideles, as they deſire to be eſteemed and accounted Chriſtians.</hi> Next their <hi>Doctrines of depoſing Kings,</hi> and of <hi>abſolving their ſubjects from obedience to them;</hi> which were not only univerſally believed, but practiſed by the <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Church for ſeveral Ages. Indeed this Doctrine hath not been at all times alike frankly and openly avowed, but it is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theirs; and hath frequently been put in execution, though they have not thought it ſo convenient at all turns to make profeſſion of it. It is a certain kind of Engine, which is to be ſcrew'd up
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59936:14"/>or let down as occaſion ſerves; and is commonly kept like <hi>Goliah's</hi> Sword in the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> behind the <hi>Ephod,</hi> but yet ſo that the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> can lend it out upon an extraordinary occaſion.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>Practices</hi> conſonant to theſe <hi>Doctrines,</hi> I ſhall go no further than the horrid and bloody <hi>Deſign</hi> of this <hi>Day.</hi> Such a <hi>Myſtery</hi> of Iniquity, as had been <hi>hid from ages and generations;</hi> Such a Maſter-piece of Villany, <hi>as eye had not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor ever</hi> before <hi>entred into the heart of man:</hi> So prodigiouſly Barbarous, both in the ſubſtance and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of it, as is not to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd in all the voluminous Records of Time from the foundation of the World.</p>
            <p>Of late years our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> (for ſo they have made themſelves without any provocation of ours) have almoſt had the impudence to deny ſo plain a matter of fact; but I wiſh they have not taken an effectual courſe by freſh Conſpiracies, of equal or greater horror, to confirm the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of it with a witneſs. But I ſhall not anticipate what will be more proper for another <hi>Day,</hi> but confine my ſelf to the preſent Occaſion.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59936:14"/>
            <p>I will not trouble you with the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Narrative of this dark Conſpiracy, nor the obſcure manner of its diſcovery, which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf acknowledges not to have been <hi>without a Miracle.</hi> Let us thank God that it was ſo happily diſcovered and diſappointed, as I hope their preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign will be by the ſame wonderful and merciful providence of God towards a moſt unworthy People. And may the <hi>lameneſs</hi> and <hi>halting</hi> of <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> the Founder of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> never depart from that <hi>Order,</hi> but be a <hi>Fate</hi> continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attending all their villanous Plots and Contrivances.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only obſerve to you, that after the diſcovery of this Plot the Authors of it were not convinced of the evil, but ſorry for the miſcarriage of it. Sir <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard Digby,</hi> whoſe very original Papers and Letters are now in my hands, after he was in Priſon, and knew he muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, calls it <hi>the beſt Cauſe;</hi> and was extremely troubled to hear it <hi>cenſured by Catholicks and Prieſts, contrary to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, for a great ſin: Let me tell you,</hi> ſays he, <hi>what a grief it is, to hear THAT ſo much condemned, which I did believe would have been otherwiſe thought of by Catholicks.</hi> And yet he concludes
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59936:15"/>that <hi>Letter</hi> with theſe words: <hi>In how full joy ſhould I dye, if I could do any thing for the Cauſe which I love more than my life?</hi> And in another <hi>Letter</hi> he ſays, he could have ſaid ſomething to have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated the <hi>odium</hi> of this buſineſs, as to that Point of involving thoſe of his own Religion in the common ruine, <hi>I dare not</hi> (ſays he) <hi>take that courſe that I could, to make it appear leſs odious, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were to have been brought out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who now would rather hurt them than otherwiſe. I do not think there would have been three worth the ſaving that ſhould have been loſt.</hi> And as to the reſt, that were to have been ſwallow'd up in that deſtruction, he ſeems not to have the leaſt relenting in his mind about them. All doubts he ſeems to have look'd upon as temptations, and <hi>intreats</hi> his Friends <hi>to pray for the pardoning of his not ſufficient striving against temptations ſince this buſineſs was undertook.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Good God! that any thing that is called Religion ſhould ſo perfectly ſtrip men of all humanity, and transform the mild and gentle race of mankind into ſuch Wolves and Tygers, that ever a pretended zeal for Thy glory ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigate men to diſhononr Thee at ſuch a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59936:15"/>rate! It is believed by many, and not without cauſe, that the Pope and his Faction are the <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> I will ſay no more than I know in this matter; I am not ſo ſure that it is <hi>he</hi> that is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly deſigned in Scripture by that Name, as I am of the main <hi>Articles</hi> of the Chriſtian Faith: But however that be, I challenge <hi>Antichriſt</hi> himſelf, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be, and whenever he comes, to do worſe and wickeder things than theſe.</p>
            <p>But I muſt remember my <hi>Text,</hi> and take heed of imitating that <hi>Spirit</hi> which is there condemned, whilſt I am inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt it. And in truth it almoſt looks uncharitably to ſpeak the truth in theſe matters, and barely to relate what theſe men have not bluſh'd to do. I need not, nay I cannot, aggravate theſe things; they are too horrible in themſelves, even when they are expreſs'd in the ſofteſt and gentleſt words.</p>
            <p>I would not be underſtood to charge every particular perſon who is, or hath been in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, with the guilt of theſe or the like practiſes: But I muſt charge their Doctrines and Principles with them; I muſt charge the <hi>Heads</hi> of their Church, and the prevalent
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59936:16"/>
               <hi>teaching</hi> and <hi>governing</hi> part of it, who are, uſually the contrivers and abetters, the executioners and applauders of theſe curſed Deſigns.</p>
            <p>I do willingly acknowledg the great Piety and Charity of ſeveral perſons who have lived and died in that Communion, as <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> Father <hi>Paul, Thuanus,</hi> and many others; who had in truth more, goodneſs than the Principles of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion do either incline men to, or allow of. And yet he that conſiders how uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally almoſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> were engaged in that <hi>Maſſacre,</hi> which is ſtill freſh in our memories, will find it very hard to determine how many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of innocency and good nature, or of coldneſs and indifferency in Religion, are neceſſary to overballance the fury of a blind zeal and a miſguided Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but <hi>Papiſts</hi> are made like other men. Nature hath not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally given them ſuch ſavage and cruel diſpoſitions, but their Religion hath made them ſo. Whereas true Chriſtianity is not only the beſt, but the beſt-natur'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution in the world; and ſo far as any Church is departed from good nature, and become cruel and barbarous, ſo far
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59936:16"/>is it degenerated from Chriſtianity. I am loth to ſay it, and yet I am confident 'tis very true, That many <hi>Papiſts</hi> would have been excellent Perſons and very good Men, if their Religion had not hindered them; if the Doctrines and Principles of their Church had not perverted and ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their natural Diſpoſitions.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak not this to exaſperate <hi>You, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Patriots and the great Bulwark of our Religion,</hi> to any <hi>unreaſonable</hi> or <hi>unneceſſary,</hi> much leſs <hi>unchriſtian</hi> Severities againſt them: No, let us not do like them; let us never do any thing for Religion that is contrary to it: But I ſpeak it to awaken your care thus far, That if their <hi>Prieſts</hi> will always be putting theſe, pernicious Principles into the minds of the <hi>People,</hi> effectual Proviſion may be made, that it may never be in their Power again to put them in Practice. We have found by Experience, that ever ſince the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> they have been continually pecking at the Foundations of our Peace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: When God knows we have been ſo far from thirſting after their Blood, that we did not ſo much as deſire their diſquiet but in order to our own neceſſary ſafety, and indeed to theirs.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59936:17"/>
            <p>And God be praiſed for thoſe matchleſs Inſtances which we are able to give of the generous humanity and Chriſtian temper of the <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants.</hi> After Q. <hi>Marys</hi> Death, when the Proteſtant Religion was reſtored, Biſhop <hi>Bonner</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all his Cruelties and But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries was permitted quietly to live and dye amongſt us. And after the <hi>Treaſon</hi> of this <hi>Day,</hi> nay at this very time ſince the diſcovery of ſo barbarous a Deſign, and the higheſt Provocation in the World, by the treacherous Murder of one of His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Juſtices of the Peace, a very good Man and a moſt excellent Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, who had been active in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of this Plot; I ſay, after all this, and notwithſtanding the continued and inſupportable inſolence of their Carriage and Behaviour, even upon this occaſion, no Violence, nay not ſo much as any inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, that I ever heard of, hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to any of them. I would to God they would but ſeriouſly conſider this one difference between <hi>our</hi> Religion and <hi>theirs,</hi> and which of them comes neareſt to <hi>the Wiſdom which is from above,</hi> which is <hi>peaceable,</hi> and <hi>gentle,</hi> and <hi>full of mercy.</hi> And I do heartily pray, and have good hopes, that upon this occaſion God will
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59936:17"/>open their eyes ſo far, as to convince a great many among them, that <hi>that</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the true Religion which inſpires men with ſuch barbarous minds.</p>
            <p>I have now done, and if I have been tranſported upon this Argument ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what beyond my uſual temper, the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this <hi>Day</hi> and our preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances will, I hope, bear me out. I have expreſſed my ſelf all along with a juſt ſenſe, and with no unjuſt ſeverity, concerning theſe horrid Principles and Practiſes; but yet with great pity and tenderneſs towards thoſe miſerably ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Souls, who have been deluded by them, and enſnared in them. And I can truly ſay, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Orator did of himſelf upon another occaſion, <hi>Me na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura miſericordem, patria ſeverum, crude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem nec patria nec natura eſſe voluit.</hi> My nature inclines me to be tender and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate; a hearty zeal for our Religion, and concernment for the publick welfare of my Country, may perhaps have made me a little ſevere; but neither my natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſpoſition, nor the temper of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, nor the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant, that is</hi> the true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, will allow me to be cruel.</p>
            <p>For the future, Let us <hi>encourage our
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59936:18"/>ſelves in the Lord our God;</hi> and <hi>commit</hi> our Cauſe, and <hi>the keeping of our Souls to Him in well doing:</hi> And, under God, let us leave it to the wiſdom and care of His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and His two Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to make a laſting Proviſion for the ſecurity of our Peace and Religion, againſt all the ſecret contrivances and open attempts of <hi>theſe ſons of violence.</hi> And let us remember thoſe words of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 37.12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>The wicked plotteth againſt the juſt, and gnaſheth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, with his teeth: The Lord ſhall laugh at him, for he ſeeth that his day is coming. The wicked have drawn out the ſword, and bent their how, to caſt down the poor and needy, and to ſlay ſuch as be of upright converſation: Their ſword ſhall enter into their own hearty, and their bows ſhall be broken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I hope, conſidering what God hath heretofore done, and hath now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to do for us, we may take encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to our ſelves againſt all the Enemies of our Religion, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated againſt us, in the words of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 9, 10. <hi>Aſſociate your ſelves, O ye People, and ye ſhall be broken in pieces, and give ear, all ye of far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: Gird your ſelves, and ye ſhall be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59936:18"/>broken in pieces: Gird your ſelves, and ye ſhall be broken in pieces: Take counſel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and it ſhall come to nought: Speak the word and it ſhall not ſtand. FOR GOD IS WITH <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now what remains, but to make our moſt devout and thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments to <hi>Almighty God,</hi> for the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable bleſſing of our <hi>Reformed</hi> Religion, and for the miraculous <hi>Deliverance</hi> of this <hi>Day,</hi> and for the wonderful <hi>Diſcovery</hi> of the late horrid and barbarous <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> againſt our <hi>Prince,</hi> our <hi>Peace,</hi> and our <hi>Religion.</hi>

               <p>AS the Chriſtian Religion in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, is the beſt Philoſophy and moſt perfect Inſtitution of Life; containing in it the moſt entire and compleat Syſtem of moral Rules and Precepts that was ever yet extant in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59936:22"/>World: ſo it peculiarly excells in the Doctrine of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> earneſtly recommending, ſtrictly enjoyning, and vehemently and almoſt perpetually preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and inculcating the excellency and neceſſity of this beſt of Graces and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and propounding to us for our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and encouragement the moſt lively and heroical Example of kindneſs and charity that ever was, in the Life and Death of the great Founder of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>the author and finiſher of our Faith, Jeſus</hi> the Son of God.</p>
               <p>So that the Goſpel, as it hath in all other parts of our Duty cleared the dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and obſcurity of <hi>natural</hi> light and ſupplied the imperfections of former <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> ſo doth it moſt eminently reign and triumph in this great and bleſſed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Charity;</hi> in which all the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy and Religions that had been before in the World, whether <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> were ſo remarkably defective.</p>

                  <hi>Sixthly</hi> and Laſtly, The Place and Rank which this Precept holds in the Chriſtian Religion. Our Saviour makes it the proper badge of a <hi>Diſciple,</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctive mark and character of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; <hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye love one another.</hi>

               <p n="1">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I. <hi>In what ſenſe our Saviour calls this Commandment of loving one another a new Commaudment;</hi> Not that it is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and altogether <hi>New,</hi> but upon ſome ſpecial accounts. For it is a branch of the ancient and primitive Law of Nature. <hi>Aristotle</hi> truly obſerves that upon grounds of natural kindted and likeneſs <hi>all men are friends,</hi> and kindly diſpoſed towards one another. And it is a known Precept of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, to <hi>love our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſome ſenſe then, it is <hi>no new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment;</hi> and ſo St. <hi>John,</hi> who was moſt likely to underſtand our Saviour's meaning in this particular, (all his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and writing being almoſt nothing elſe but an inculcating of this one Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept) explains this matter, telling us that in ſeveral reſpects it was, and it was not <hi>a new Commandment,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>Brethren, I write no new Commandment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  </gap>, <hi>but yet, a new Commandment I write unto you.</hi> So that though it was not abſolutely <hi>new,</hi> yet upon divers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable accounts it was ſo, and in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner proper to the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Inſtitution; and is in ſo expreſs and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular a manner aſcribed to the teaching of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which was conferr'd upon Chriſtians by the Faith of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as if there hardly needed any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inſtruction and exhortation to that purpoſe, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.9 <hi>But as touching brotherly love, ye need not that I write unto you, for ye your ſelves are</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This Commandment then of <hi>loving one another</hi> is by our Lord and Saviour ſo much enlarged as to the <hi>Object</hi> of it, beyond what either the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Heathens</hi> did underſtand it to be, extending to all mankind, and even to our greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; ſo greatly advanced and heightned as to the <hi>Degree</hi> of it, even to the laying down of our lives for one another; ſo effectually taught, ſo mightily encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſo very much urged and inſiſted
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59936:24"/>upon, that it may very well be called a <hi>new Commandment:</hi> for though it was not altogether unknown to Mankind before, yet it was never ſo taught, ſo encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; never was ſuch an illuſtrious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample given of it, never ſo much weight and ſtreſs laid upon it by any Philoſophy or Religion that was before in the world.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> II. I ſhall endeavour to declare to you the <hi>Nature of this Commandment, or the Duty required by it.</hi> And that will beſt be done, by inſtancing in the chief <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of Love and Charity. As, <hi>humanity</hi> and kindneſs in all our carriage and behaviour towards one another; for Love ſmooths the diſpoſitions of men ſo that they are not apt to grate upon one another: Next, to <hi>rejoyce</hi> in the good and happineſs of one another, and to <hi>grieve</hi> at their evils and ſufferings; for Love unites the intereſts of men ſo as to make them affected with what happens to another as if it were in ſome ſort their own caſe: Then, to contribute as much as in us lies to the happineſs of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by relieving one anothers wants and redreſſing their misfortunes: Again, tenderneſs of their good name and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; a proneneſs to interpret all the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59936:24"/>words and actions of men to the beſt ſenſe; patience and forbearance towards one another; and when differences hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, to manage them with all poſſible calmneſs and kindneſs, and to be ready to forgive and to be reconciled to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; to pray one for another; and if occaſion be, at leaſt if the publick good of Chriſtianity require it, to be ready to lay down our lives for our brethren, and to ſacrifice our ſelves for the furtherance of their Salvation.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> III. We will conſider the <hi>Degrees and meaſures of our Charity, with regard to the various Objects about which it is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to the <hi>negative</hi> part of this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is to be extended equally towards all. We are not to hate or bear ill-will to any man, or to do him any harm or miſchief; <hi>Love worketh no evil to his neighbour.</hi> Thus much charity we are to exerciſe towards all without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, without any difference.</p>
               <p>And as to the <hi>poſitive</hi> part of this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we ſhould bear an univerſal good-will to all men, wiſhing every man's happineſs, and praying for it as heartily as for our own: And if we be ſincere herein, we
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59936:25"/>ſhall be ready upon all occaſions to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and promote the welfare of all men. But the outward acts and teſtimonies of our Charity neither can be actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all, nor ought to be to all alike. We do not know the wants of all, and therefore our knowledg of perſons, and of their conditions doth neceſſarily limit the effects of our Charity within a certain compaſs; and of thoſe we do know, we can but relieve a ſmall part for want of ability. Whence it becomes neceſſary, that we ſet ſome rules to our ſelves for the more diſcreet ordering of our Charity; ſuch as theſe: Caſes of extremity ought to take place of all other. Obligations of Nature, and nearneſs of Relation, ſeem to challenge the next place. Obligations of kindneſs, and upon the account of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits received, may well lay the next claim. And then the <hi>Houſhold of Faith</hi> is to be peculiarly conſidered. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe, the merit of the perſons, and all circumſtances belonging to them, are to be weighed and valued: Thoſe who labour in an honeſt calling, but are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd with their charge; thoſe who are fallen from a plentiful condition, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by misfortune, and the providence of God, without their own fault; thoſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59936:25"/>who have relieved others, and have been eminently charitable and beneficial to mankind; and laſtly, thoſe whoſe viſible neceſſities and infirmities of body or mind, whether by age or by accident, do plead for them: All theſe do challenge our more eſpecial regard and conſideration.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> IV. We will conſider <hi>our Obligations to this Duty, not only from our Saviour's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but likewiſe from our own Nature, and from the reaſonableneſs and Excellency of the thing commanded.</hi> This is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> who came down from Heaven with full Authority to declare the Will of God to us. And this is peculiarly <hi>His Commandment,</hi> which he urgeth upon his Diſciples ſo earneſtly, and ſo as if he almoſt required nothing elſe in compariſon of this. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.12. <hi>This is my Commandment, that ye love one another:</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>Theſe things I command you, that ye love one another.</hi> As if this were the end of all his Precepts, and of his whole Doctrine, to bring us to the practice of this Duty. And ſo St. <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>beloved Diſciple,</hi> ſpeaks of it as the great <hi>Meſſage</hi> which the Son of God was to deliver to mankind, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.11. <hi>This is the Meſſage which ye
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59936:26"/>have heard from the beginning, that ye ſhould love one another.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>This is his Commandment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us Commandment.</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>This Commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God, love his Brother alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides the Authority of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, we have precedent obligation to it from our own Nature, and from the Reaſonableneſs and Excellency of the thing it ſelf. The frame of our Nature diſpoſeth us to it, and our inclination to Society, in which there can be no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, no advantage, without mutual love and kindneſs. And <hi>Equity</hi> alſo calls for it, for that we our ſelves wiſh and expect kindneſs from others is conviction enough to us that we owe it to others. The ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of this Law is the great perfection of our Natures, the advancement and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of our Souls, the chief orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and beauty of a great mind. It makes us like to God, the beſt and moſt perfect and happieſt Being, in that which is the prime excellency and happineſs and glory of the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>And the advantages of this temper are unſpeakable and innumerable. It freeth
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59936:26"/>our ſouls from thoſe unruly and Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and diſquieting Paſſions which are the great torment of our Spirits; from Anger and Envy, from Malice and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, from Jealouſie and Diſcontent. It makes our minds calm and cheerful, and puts our ſouls into an eaſie poſture, and into good humour, and maintains us in the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of our ſelves: It preſerves men from many miſchiefs and inconveniences, to which enmity and ill-will do perpetually expoſe them: It is apt to make Friends, and to gain Enemies, and to render every condition either plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, or eaſie, or tolerable to us. So that to love others, is the trueſt love to our ſelves, and doth redound to our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable benefit and advantage in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p>It is a very conſiderable part of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and almoſt equall'd by our Saviour with the <hi>first and great Commandment of the Law.</hi> It is highly acceptable to God, moſt beneficial to others, and very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to our ſelves. It is the eaſieſt of all Duties, and it makes all others eaſie; the pleaſure of it makes the pains to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing, and the delightful reflection upon it afterwards is a moſt ample reward of it. It is a Duty in every man's power
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59936:27"/>to perform, how ſtrait and indigent ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his fortune and condition be. The pooreſt man may be as charitable as a Prince; he may have as much kindneſs in his heart, though his hand cannot be ſo bountiful and munificent. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our inſtanceth in the giving of a <hi>cup of cold water,</hi> as a Charity that will be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accepted and rewarded by God. And one of the moſt celebrated Charities that ever was, how ſmall was it for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, and yet how great in regard of the mind that gave it? I mean the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow's <hi>two mites,</hi> which ſhe <hi>cast into the Treaſury:</hi> One could hardly give leſs, and yet none can give more, for ſhe gave <hi>all that ſhe had.</hi> All theſe excellencies and advantages of Love and Charity, which I have briefly recounted, are ſo many Arguments, ſo many obligations to the practice of this Duty.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> V. We will conſider <hi>the great Inſtance and Example which is here propounded to our imitation; As I have loved you, that ye alſo love one another.</hi> The Son of God's becoming man, his whole Life, his bitter Death and Paſſion, all that he did and all that he ſuffered, was one great and continued proof and evidence of his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59936:27"/>mighty love to mankind. The greateſt Inſtance of love among men, and that too but very rare, is for a Man <hi>to lay down his life for another, for his Friend;</hi> but the Son of God died for all mankind, and we were all his enemies. And ſhould we not cheerfully imitate the Example of that great Love and Charity, the effects whereof are ſo comfortable, ſo beneficial, ſo happy to every one of us. Had he not loved us, and died for us, we had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly periſh'd, we had been miſerable and undone to all eternity.</p>
               <p>And to perpetuate this great Example of Charity, and that it might be always freſh in our memories, the great Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Religion was on purpoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for the Commemoration of this great love of the Son of God, in laying down his life and ſhedding his precious blood for the wicked and rebellious Race of mankind. But I have not time to enlarge upon this noble Argument as it deſerves.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> VI. The <hi>last</hi> thing to be conſidered is <hi>the place and rank which this Precept and Duty holds in the Chriſtian Religion.</hi> Our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> here makes it the proper badg and cogniſance of our Profeſſion;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59936:28"/>
                  <hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye love one another.</hi> The different <hi>Sects</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> had ſome peculiar Character to diſtinguiſh them from one another: The <hi>Scholars</hi> of the ſeveral great <hi>Rabbi</hi>'s among them had ſome peculiar Sayings and Opinions, ſome Cuſtoms and Traditions whereby they were ſeverally known; And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> were particularly remarkable for their great Auſterities. In alluſion to theſe diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Schools</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> fixeth upon this mark and character whereby his Diſciples ſhould be known from the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of any other Inſtitution, <hi>A mighty love and affection to one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Other <hi>Sects</hi> were diſtinguiſh'd by little Opinions, or by ſome external Rites and Obſervances in Religion; but our <hi>Saviour</hi> pitcheth upon that which is the moſt real and ſubſtantial, the moſt large and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, the moſt uſeful and beneficial, the moſt <hi>humane</hi> and the moſt <hi>divine</hi> quality of which we are capable.</p>
               <p>This was his great Commandment to his Diſciples, before he left the World: This was the Legacy he left them, and the effect of his laſt Prayers for them:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59936:28"/>And for this end, among others, he inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Sacrament of his bleſſed Body and Blood, to be a lively remembrance of his great Charity to mankind, and a perpetual bond of Love and Union a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Followers.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour do upon all occaſions recommend this to us, as a principal Duty and Part of our Religion; telling us, That <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that is, in the Chriſtian Religion, nothing will <hi>avail,</hi> no not <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf, unleſs it be enlivened and <hi>inſpired by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> That <hi>Love is the end of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>end of the Evangelical declaration,</hi> the firſt <hi>Fruit of the Spirit,</hi> the ſpring and root of all thoſe Graces and Virtues which concern our duty towards one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: That it is the <hi>ſum</hi> and abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the accompliſhment and <hi>fulfilling of the whole Law:</hi> That without this, whatever we pretend to in Chriſtianity, <hi>we are nothing,</hi> and our <hi>Religion is vain:</hi> That this is the greateſt of all Graces and Virtues, greater than <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope;</hi> and of perpetual uſe and duration, <hi>Charity ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fails.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore they exhort us above all things to endeavour after it, as the Crown
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59936:29"/>of all other Virtues; <hi>Above all things have fervent charity among your ſelves,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter:</hi> And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> having enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated moſt other Chriſtian Virtues, exhorts us above all to ſtrive after this, <hi>And above all theſe things put on charity, which is the bond of perfection.</hi> This St. <hi>John</hi> makes one of the moſt certain ſigns of our love to God, and the want of it an undeniable argument of the contrary: <hi>If a man ſay I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a lyar; for he who loveth not his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen? This</hi> he declares to be one of the beſt evidences that we are in a ſtate of Grace and Salvation, <hi>Hereby we know that we are paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that well might our bleſſed Saviour chuſe this for the badge of his Diſciples, and make it the great Precept of the beſt and moſt perfect Inſtitution? Other things might have ſerved better for pomp and oſtentation, and have more gratified the Curioſity, or Enthuſiaſm, or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of mankind, but there is no quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the World which upon a ſober and impartial conſideration is of a more ſolid and intrinſick value.</p>
               <p>And in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59936:29"/>the Chriſtians were very eminent for this Vertue, and particularly noted for it; <hi>Nobis notam inurit apud quoſdam, it is a mark and brand ſet upan us by ſome,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian;</hi> and he tells us that it was proverbially ſaid among the <hi>Heathen, Behold how theſe Chriſtians love one another. Lucian,</hi> that great ſcoffer at all Religion, acknowledgeth in behalf of Chriſtians, that this was the great Principle which <hi>their Maſter</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd into them: And <hi>Julian,</hi> the bittereſt Enemy that Chriſtianity ever had, could not forbear to propound to the <hi>Heathen</hi> for an example the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Galileans,</hi> for ſo by way of reproach he calls the <hi>Chriſtians, who</hi> (ſays he) <hi>gave up themſelves to humanity</hi> and kindneſs; which he acknowledgeth to have been very much to the advantage and reputation of our Religion: And in the ſame <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to <hi>Arſacius,</hi> the <hi>Heathen</hi> High Prieſt of <hi>Galatia,</hi> he gives this memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Teſtimony of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that their Charity was not limited and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd onely to themſelves, but exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded even to their Enemies; which could not be ſaid either of the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Heathens:</hi> His words are theſe, <hi>It is a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59936:30"/>ſhame, that when the</hi> Jews <hi>ſuffer none of theirs to beg, and the impious</hi> Galileans <hi>relieve not onely their own, but thoſe alſo of our Religion, that we onely ſhould be defective in ſo neceſſary a Duty.</hi> By all which it is evident that Love and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not onely the great Precept of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> but was in thoſe firſt and beſt Times the general practice of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and acknowledged by the <hi>Heathens</hi> as a very peculiar and remarkable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in them.</p>

               <p>It is now but too viſible how groſly this great Commandment of our Saviour is contradicted, not onely by the Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thoſe in that Communion, from the <hi>Pope</hi> down to the meaneſt <hi>Fryar;</hi> but by the very Doctrines and Principles, by the <hi>Genius</hi> and Spirit of that Religion, which is wholly calculated for cruelty and perſecution.

Bellarmine</hi> reckons up no leſs than <hi>fifteen</hi> marks of the rrue Church, all which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> arrogates to her ſelf alone: But he wiſely forgot that which is worth all the reſt, and which our Saviour inſiſts upon as the chief of all other, <hi>A ſincere Love and Charity to all Chriſtians:</hi> This he knew would by no means agree to his own Church.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:59936:31"/>
               <p>But for all that, it is very reaſonable that Churches as well as particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould be judged by their Charity. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would engroſs all Faith to her ſelf; Faith in its utmoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, to the degree and pitch of Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility: And they allow no body in the world, beſides themſelves, no though they believe all the Articles of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed, to have one grain of true Faith; becauſe they do not believe upon the Authority of their Church, which they pretend to be the onely foundation of true Faith. This is a moſt arrogant and vain pretence; but admit it were true, yet in the Judgement of St. <hi>Paul, Though they had all Faith, if they have not Charity, they are nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greateſt wonder of all is this, that they who hate and perſecute Chriſtians moſt, do all this while the moſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of all others pretend to be the Diſciples of Chriſt, and will allow none to be ſo but themſelves, <hi>That</hi> Church which excommunicates all other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches in the world, and if ſhe could, would extirpate them out of the world, will yet needs aſſume to her ſelf to be the only Chriſtian Church: As if our Saviour had ſaid, <hi>Hereby ſhall all men
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59936:31"/>know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye hate, and excommunicate, and kill one another. What ſhall he done unto thee, thou falſe tongue?</hi> thou empty and impudent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Chriſtianity!</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, <hi>With relation to our ſeves, who profeſs the Proteſtant Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> How is this great Precept of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour not onely ſhamefully neglected, but plainly violated by us? And that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by private hatred and ill-will, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and contentions in our civil conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and entercourſe with one another; but by moſt unchriſtian diviſions and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimoſities in that common relation wherein we ſtand to one another, as <hi>Brethren,</hi> as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Have we not all one Father? hath not one God created us?</hi> And are we not in a more peculiar and eminent manner <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> being <hi>all the children of God by faith in Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Are we not all members of the ſame Body, and parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the ſame Spirit, and Heirs of the ſame bleſſed Hopes of eternal life?</p>
               <p>So that being Brethren upon ſo many accounts, and by ſo many bonds and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments all united to one another, and all travelling towards the ſame heavenly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59936:32"/>Country, <hi>why do we fall out by the way, ſince we are Brethren?</hi> Why do we not as becomes <hi>Brethren,</hi> dwell together in unity? but are ſo apt to quarrel and break out into heats, to crumble into Sects and Parties, to divide and ſeparate from one another upon every ſlight and trifling occaſion.</p>
               <p>Give me leave a little more fully to expoſtulate this matter, but very calmly and <hi>in the ſpirit of meekneſs,</hi> and in the name of our dear <hi>Lord</hi> who loved us all at ſuch a rate as to die for us, to recommend to you this <hi>new Commandment</hi> of his, <hi>that ye love one another:</hi> Which is almoſt a <hi>new Commandment</hi> ſtill, and hardly the worſe for wearing; ſo ſeldom it is put on, and ſo little hath it been practiſed among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians for ſeveral Ages.</p>
               <p>Conſider ſeriouſly with your ſelves; ought not the great matters wherein we are agreed, our union in the Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion and in all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Articles of that <hi>Faith which was once delivered to the Saints,</hi> in the ſame Sacraments, and in all the ſubſtantial parts of God's worſhip, and in the great Duties and Vertues of the Chriſtian life, to be of greater force to unite us, than difference in doubtful Opinions, and in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59936:32"/>little Rites and Circumſtances of worſhip to divide and break us?</p>
               <p>Are not the things about which we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in their nature <hi>indifferent,</hi> that is, things about which there ought to be no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among wiſe men? Are they not at a great diſtance from the life and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Religion, and rather good or bad as they tend to the Peace and Unity of the Church, or are made uſe of to Schiſm and Faction, than either neceſſary or evil in themſelves? And ſhall little ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples weigh ſo far with us, as by breaking the Peace of the Church about them to endanger our whole Religion? Shall we take one another by <hi>the throat for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pence,</hi> when our common Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtands ready to clap upon us an Action of <hi>ten thouſand talents?</hi> Can we in good earneſt be contented that rather than the <hi>Surplice</hi> ſhould not be thrown out, <hi>Popery</hi> ſhould come in; and rather than receive the Sacrament in the humble but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent poſture of <hi>kneeling,</hi> to ſwallow the Camel of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> the Elements of Bread and Wine for our God and Saviour? and rather than to ſubmit to a <hi>Set Form</hi> of Prayer, to have the Service of God perform'd in an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:59936:33"/>
               <p>Are we not yet made ſenſible, <hi>at leaſt in this our Day,</hi> by ſo clear a Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the Providence of God hath lately given us: and had not He been infinitely merciful to us, might have proved the deareſt and moſt dangerous Experiment that ever was: I ſay, are we not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, what mighty advantages our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies have made of our Diviſions, and what a plentiful harveſt they have had among us, during our Differences, and upon occaſion of them; and how near their Religion was to have entred in upon us at once, at thoſe wide breaches which we had made for it? And will we ſtill take counſel of our Enemies, and chuſe to follow that courſe to which, of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they who hate us and ſeek our ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine would moſt certainly adviſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us? Will we freely offer them that advantage which they would be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to purchaſe at any rate?</p>
               <p>Let us after all our ſad experience, at laſt take Warning to keep a ſtedfaſt eye upon our chief Enemy, and not ſuffer our ſelves to be diverted from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and regard of our greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by the petty provocations of our Friends; ſo I chuſe to call thoſe who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from us in leſſer matters, becauſe I
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59936:33"/>would fain have them ſo, and they ought in all reaſon to be ſo: But however they behave themſelves, we ought not much to mind thoſe who only fling dirt at us, whilſt we are ſure there are others who fly at our throats, and ſtrike at our very hearts.</p>
               <p>Let us learn this wiſdom of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who though they have many great differences among themſelves, yet they have made a ſhift at this time to unite together to deſtroy us: And ſhall not we do as much to ſave our ſelves?</p>
               <q>—fas est &amp; ab hoſte doceri.</q>
               <p>It was a Principle among the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> a brave and a wiſe People, <hi>dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re inimicitias Reip.</hi> to give up and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice their private enmities and quarrels to the publick good and the ſafety of the Common-wealth. And is it not to every conſiderate man as clear as the Sun at Noonday, that nothing can maintain and ſupport the Proteſtant Religion amongſt us, and <hi>found</hi> our Church <hi>upon a Rock,</hi> ſo that <hi>when the rain falls, and the winds blow, and the floods beat upon it,</hi> it ſhall <hi>ſtand</hi> firm and unſhaken: That nothing can be a Bulwark of ſufficient force to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59936:34"/>reſiſt all the arts and attempts of
Popery, but <hi>an eſtabliſht National Religion,</hi> firmly united and compacted in all the parts of it? Is it not plain to every eye, that little <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>ſeparate Congregations</hi> can never do it? but will be like a Foundation of <hi>ſand</hi> to a weighty Building, which what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhew it may make cannot ſtand long, becauſe it wants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Union at the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for that reaſon muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly want ſtrength and firmneſs.</p>
               <p>It is not for private perſons to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in matters of publick concernment; but I think we have no cauſe to doubt, but the Governors of our Church (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the advantages of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and we think of reaſon too on our ſide) are Perſons of that Piety and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that for Peace ſake, and in order to a firm Union among Proteſtants, they would be content, if that would do it, not to inſiſt upon little things; but to yield them up, whether to the infirmity, or importunity, or, perhaps in ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few things, to the plauſible exceptions of thoſe who differ from us.</p>
               <p>But then ſurely on the other ſide, men ought to bring along with them a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpoſition, and a mind ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Church in which they were
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59936:34"/>born and baptized, in all reaſonable and lawful things, and deſirous upon any terms that are tolerable to return to the Communion of it: a mind free from paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and prejudice, from peeviſh exceptions, and groundleſs and endleſs ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; not apt to inſiſt upon little cavils and objections, to which the very beſt things, and the greateſt and cleareſt Truths in the world are and always will be liable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And whatever they have been heretofore, to be <hi>henceforth no more chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine, by the ſleight of men and cunning craftineſs of thoſe who lie in wait to deceive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if we were thus affected on all hands, we might yet be a happy Church and Nation; if we would govern our ſelves by theſe Rules and walk according to them, <hi>peace</hi> would be <hi>upon us, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and on the</hi> Iſrael <hi>of God.</hi>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall conclude all with a few words <hi>in relation to the occaſion of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent meeting.</hi> I have all this while been recommending to you, from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Example of our Bleſſed Saviour, and from the nature and reaſon of the thing it ſelf, this moſt exellent Grace and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59936:35"/>Virtue of Charity, in the moſt proper Acts and Inſtances of it: But beſides par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Acts of Charity to be exerciſed upon emergent occaſions, there are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe charitable Cuſtoms which are highly commendable, becauſe they are more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and conſtant, of a larger extent, and of a longer continuance: As the <hi>Meeting</hi> of the <hi>Sons</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> which is now form'd and eſtabliſh'd into a <hi>charitable Corporation:</hi> And the Anniverſary <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of thoſe of the ſeveral <hi>Counties</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who reſide, or happen to be in <hi>London;</hi> for <hi>two</hi> of the beſt and nobleſt ends that can be, the maintaining of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> and the promoting of <hi>Charity.</hi> Theſe, and others of the like kind, I call <hi>charitable cuſtoms,</hi> which of late years have very much obtained in this great and famous City. And it cannot but be a great pleaſure and ſatisfaction to all good men, to ſee ſo generous, ſo humane, ſo Chriſtian a diſpoſition to prevail and reign ſo much amongſt us.</p>
               <p>The ſtrange overflowing of vice and wickedneſs in our Land, and the prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous increaſe and impudence of infidelity and impiety, hath of late years boaded very ill to us, and brought terrible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon this City and Nation, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59936:35"/>ſeems ſtill to threaten us with more and greater: And the greateſt comfort I have had under theſe ſad apprehenſions of Gods diſpleaſure hath been this, that though <hi>bad</hi> men were perhaps never worſe in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Age, yet the <hi>good,</hi> who I hope are not a few, were never more truly and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially good: I do verily believe there never were, in any Time, greater and more real effects of Charity; not from a blind ſuperſtition, and an ignorant zeal, and a mercenary and arrogant and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous principle of Merit, but from a ſound knowledg, and a ſincere love and obedience to God, or, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, <hi>out of a pure heart, and of a good conſcience, and of faith unfeigned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And who, that loves God and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can chuſe but take great contentment to ſee ſo general and forward an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in People this way? Which hath been very much cheriſhed of late years by this ſort of Meetings: and that to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good purpoſe and effect, in many charitable contributions diſpoſed in the beſt and wiſeſt ways: and which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hath tended very much to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling of the minds of men, and the allaying of thoſe fierce heats and animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which have ben cauſed by our Civil
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59936:36"/>confuſions, and Religious diſtractions. For there is nothing many times wanting to take away prejudice, and to extinguiſh hatred and ill-will, but an opportunity for men to ſee and underſtand one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; by which they will quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that they are not ſuch Monſters as they have been repreſented one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother at a diſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We</hi> are, I think, one of the laſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>England</hi> that have entred into this friendly and charitable kind of Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Let us make amends for our late ſetting out by quickning our pace, that ſo we may overtake and outſtrip thoſe who are gone before us: Let not our Charity partake of the coldneſs of our Climate, but let us endeavour that it may be equal to the extent of our Country; and as we are incomparably the greateſt <hi>County</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> let it appear that we are ſo by the largeneſs and extent of our Charity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Lord, who haſt taught us that all our doings without Charity are nothing, ſend thy Holy Ghoſt, and pour into our hearts that moſt excellent gift of Charity, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bond of Peace, and of all Vertues: Without which whoſover liveth, is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59936:36"/>dead before thee. Grant this for thy only Son Jeſus Chriſt's ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now the God of Peace, who brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from the dead our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the blood of the everlaſting Covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be glory for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <head>A SERMON Preached at <hi>WHITE-HALL,</hi> April 4th, 1679.</head>

                  <bibl>
                     <hi>1 JOHN IV. 1.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>Beloved, believe not every ſpirit, but try the ſpirits whether they are of God; becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out into the World.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS caution and counſel was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon occaſion of the falſe Prophets and Teachers that were riſen up in the beginning of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, who endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſeduce men from the true Doctrine of the Goſpel delivered by the Apoſtles of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59936:38"/>our Lord and Saviour. And theſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary things, could not both be from God: and therefore St. <hi>John</hi> calls upon Chriſtians to examine the Doctrines and Pretences of thoſe new Teachers, whether they were from God or not. <hi>Believe not every Spirit; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat is,</hi> not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that takes upon him to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired and to be a Teacher come from God: <hi>But try the Spirits; that is,</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thoſe that make this pretence, whether it be real or not; and examine the Doctrines which they bring, becauſe there are many Impoſtors abroad in the World.</p>
            <p>This is the plain ſenſe of the Words: In which there are contained theſe <hi>four</hi> Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That men may, and often do, falſly pretend to Inſpiration.</hi> And this is the reaſon upon which the Apoſtle grounds this Exhortation: <hi>Becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out into the world,</hi> therefore we ſhould try who are true, and who are falſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>We are not to believe every one that pretends to be inſpired, and to teach a Divine Doctrine:</hi> This follows upon the former; becauſe men may falſly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59936:38"/>pretend to Inſpiration, therefore we are not to believe every one that makes this pretence. For any man that hath but confidence enough, and conſcience little enough, may pretend to come from God. And if we admit all pretences of this kind, we lie at the mercy of every crafty and confident man to be led by him into what deluſions he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Neither are we to reject all that pretend to come from God.</hi> This is ſufficiently implied in the <hi>Text;</hi> for when the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays <hi>believe not every Spirit,</hi> he ſuppoſeth we are to believe ſome; and when he ſaith <hi>try the Spirits whether they be of God,</hi> he ſuppoſeth ſome to be of God, and that thoſe which are ſo are to be believed. Theſe <hi>three</hi> Obſervations are ſo plain that I need only to name them, to make way for the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth,</hi> Which I principally deſigned to inſiſt upon from theſe Words. And that is this, <hi>That there is ſome way to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern mere pretenders to Inſpiration, from thoſe who are truly and Divinely inſpired:</hi> And this is neceſſarily implied in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> bidding us to <hi>try the Spirits whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are of God.</hi> For it were in vain to make any trial, if there be no way to diſcern between pretended and real Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <pb n="72" facs="tcp:59936:39"/>
            <p>Now the handling of this will give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to <hi>two</hi> very material Enquiries, and uſeful to be reſolved.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. <hi>How we may diſcern between true and counterfeit Doctrines:</hi> thoſe which really are from God, and thoſe which only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be ſo?</item>
               <item>II. <hi>To whom this judgement of diſcerning doth appertain?</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>How we may diſcern between true and counterfeit Doctrines and Revelations?</hi> for the clearing of this I ſhall lay down theſe following Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>That Reaſon is the faculty whereby Revelations are to be diſcerned;</hi> or to uſe the phraſe in the <hi>text,</hi> it is that whereby we are to judge what <hi>Spirits are of God, and what not.</hi> For all Revelation from God ſuppoſeth us to be men, and to be indued with Reaſon; and therefore it does not create new Faculties in us, but propounds new Objects to that Faculty which was in us before. Whatever Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines God reveals to men are propounded to their Underſtandings, and by this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty we are to examine all Doctrines which pretend to be from God, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59936:39"/>on examination to judge whether there be reaſon to receive them as Divine, or to reject them as Impoſtures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>All ſupernatural Revelation ſuppoſeth the truth of the Principles of Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> We muſt firſt be aſſured that there is a God, before we can know that he hath made any Revelation of himſelf: and we muſt know that his Words are true, otherwiſe there were no ſufficient reaſon to believe the Revelations which he makes to us: and we muſt believe his Authority over us, and that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our obedience to his Laws, and puniſh our breach of them; otherwiſe there would neither be ſufficient obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor encouragement to Obedience. Theſe and many other things are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be true, and naturally known to us, antecedently to all ſupernatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; otherwiſe the Revelations of God would ſignifie nothing to us, nor be of any force with us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>All Reaſonings about Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt neceſſarily be governed by the Principles of Natural Religion: that is,</hi> by thoſe apprehenſions which men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally have of the Divine perfections, and by the clear Notions of good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil which are imprinted upon our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59936:40"/>Becauſe we have no other way to judge what is worthy of God and credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be revealed by him, and what not, but by the natural notions which we have of God and of his eſſential perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: which, becauſe we know him to be immutable, we have reaſon to believe he will never contradict. And by theſe Principles likewiſe, we are to interpret what God hath revealed; and when any doubt ariſeth concerning the meaning of any divine Revelation (as that of the Holy Scriptures) we are to govern our ſelves in the interpretation of it by what is moſt agreeable to thoſe natural Notions which we have of God, and we have all the reaſon in the World to reject that ſenſe which is contrary thereto. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when God is repreſented in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as having a humane ſhape, eyes, ears and hands, the Notions which men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have of the Divine Nature and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections do ſufficiently direct us to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptet theſe expreſſions in a ſenſe worthy of God, and agreeable to his Perfection: And therefore it is reaſonable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them as rather ſpoken to our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and in a Figure, than to be literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended. And this will proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hold in many other caſes.</p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:59936:40"/>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Nothing ought to be received as a Revelation from God which plainly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the Principles of Natural Religion, or overthrows the certainty of them.</hi> For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it were in vain to pretend a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from God, <hi>That there is no God,</hi> becauſe this is a contradiction in terms. So likewiſe to pretend a command from God, <hi>That we are to hate and deſpiſe him;</hi> becauſe it is not credible that God ſhould require any thing of Reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo unſuitable to their Natures, and to their Obligations to him; Beſides that ſuch a Law as this does tacitly involve a contradiction; becauſe upon ſuch a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to deſpiſe God would be to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him; and yet to obey him is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to honour him. So that in this caſe to honour God, and to deſpiſe him, would be the ſame thing, and equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of him. In like manner, it would be vain to pretend any Revelation from God, <hi>That there is no life after this, nor rewards and puniſhments in another World:</hi> becauſe this is contrary to thoſe natural apprehenſions which have generally poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt mankind, and would take away the main force and ſanction of the divine Laws. The like may be ſaid concerning any pretended Revelation from God,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59936:41"/>which evidently contradicts thoſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notions which men have of good and evil; as, <hi>That God ſhould command, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Sedition and Rebellion, Perfidiouſneſs and Perjury;</hi> becauſe the practiſe of theſe would be apparently deſtructive of the peace and happineſs of Mankind, and would naturally bring confuſion into the World: But <hi>God is not the God of Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but of Order,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> appeals to as a Principle naturally knowu. Upon the ſame account nothing ought to be entertained as a Divine Revelation <hi>which overthrows the certainty of the Principles of natural Religion;</hi> becauſe that would take away the certainty of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation it ſelf, which ſuppoſeth the truth of thoſe Principles. For inſtance, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pretends any Revelation <hi>that brings the Providence of God into queſtion,</hi> does by that very thing make ſuch a Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on queſtionable. For if God take no care of the World, have no concernment for humane affairs, why ſhould we believe that he makes any Revelation of his Will to men? And by this Principle <hi>Moſes</hi> will have falſe Prophets to be tried: <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1. <hi>If there ariſe among you a Prophet, and giveth thee a ſign or wonder, and the ſignor the wonder come to paſs whereof he
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59936:41"/>ſpake unto thee, ſaying, Let us go after o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods, and let us ſerve them; thou ſhalt not hearken unto the words of that Prophet:</hi> And he gives the reaſon of this, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Becauſe he hath ſpoken unto you to turn you away from the Lord your God, which brought you out of the Land of Egypt.</hi> Here is a caſe wherein a falſe Prophet is ſuppoſed to work a true Miracle to give credit to his Doctrine, (which in other caſes the Scripture makes the ſign of a true Prophet) but yet in this caſe he is to be rejected as an Impoſtor: Becauſe the Doctrine he teacheth would draw men off from the worſhip of the true God who is naturally known, and had mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted himſelf to the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in ſo miraculous a manner, by bringing them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> So that a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle is not enough to give credit to a Prophet who teacheth any thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that natural Notion which men have, <hi>That there is but one God, who only ought to be worſhipped.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Nothing ought to he received as a Divine Doctrine and Revelation, without good evidence that it is ſo: that is,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Argument ſufficient to ſatisfie a prudent and conſiderate man. Now (ſuppoſing there be nothing in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59936:42"/>of the Revelation that is evidently contrary to the Principles of Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor to any former Revelation which hath already received a greater and more ſolemn atteſtation from God) Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are owned by all Mankind to be a ſufficient Teſtimony to any Perſon, or Doctrine, that are from God. This was the Teſtimony which God gave to <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſatisfie the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that he had ſent him; <hi>Exed.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Moſes ſaid, They will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will ſay, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee.</hi> Upon this God endues him with a power of Miracles, to be an evidence to them, <hi>That they may believe that the God of their Fathers, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſaac and Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.</hi> And all along in the <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> when God ſent his Prophets to make a new Revelation, or upon any ſtrange and extraordinary meſſage, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways gave credit to them by ſome Sign or Wonder which they foretold or wrought. And when he ſent his <hi>Son</hi> into the World, he gave Teſtimony to him by innumerable great and unqueſtionable Miracles, more and grearer than <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the Prophets had wrought. And there was great reaſon for this: becauſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59936:42"/>our Saviour came not only to publiſh a new Religion to the World, but to put an end to that Religion which God had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted before. And now that the Goſpel hath had the confirmation of ſuch Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles as never were wrought upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion, no Evidence inferiour to this can in reaſon controul this Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or give credit to any thing contrary to it And therefore though the falſe Prophets and Antichriſts, foretold by our Saviour, did really work Miracles, yet they were ſo inconſiderable in compariſon of our Saviour's, that they deſerve no credit in oppoſition to that Revelation which had ſo clear a Teſtimony given to it from Heaven by Miracles, beſides all other concurring Arguments to confirm it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And <hi>Laſtly, No Argument is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prove a Doctrine or Revelation to be from God, which is not clearer and ſtronger than the Difficulties and Objections againſt it:</hi> Becauſe all aſſent is grounded upon Evidence, and the ſtrongeſt and cleareſt evidence always carries it: But where the evidence is equal on both ſides, that can produce nothing but a ſuſpenſe and doubt in the mind whether the thing be true or not. If <hi>Moſes</hi> had not confuted
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59936:43"/>
               <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Magicians by working Miracles which they could not work, they might reaſonably have diſputed it with him who had been the true Prophet: But when he did works plainly above the power of their Magick and the Devil to do, then they ſubmitted, and acknowledged that <hi>there was the Finger of God.</hi> So likewiſe, though a perſon work a Miracle (which ordinarily is a good evidence that he is ſent by God) yet if the Doctrine he brings be plainly contrary to thoſe natural No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which we have of God, this is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter objection againſt the truth of this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine than the other is a proof of it; as is plain in the caſe which <hi>Moſes</hi> puts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. which I mentioned before.</p>
            <p>Upon the ſame account no man can reaſonably believe the Doctrine of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi> to be revealed by God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every man hath as great evidence that Tranſubſtantiation is falſe, as any man can pretend to have that God hath revealed any ſuch thing. Suppoſe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation to be part of the Chriſtian Doctrine, it muſt have the ſame confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation with the whole, and that is <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles:</hi> But of all Doctrines in the world it is peculiarly incapable of being proved by a Miracle. For if a Miracle were
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59936:43"/>wrought for the proof of it, the very ſame aſſurance which a man hath of the truth of the Miracle, he hath of the falſhood of the Doctrine, <hi>that is,</hi> the clear evidence of his ſenſes for both. For that there is a Miracle wrought to prove, <hi>that what he ſees in the Sacrament is not bread but the body of Chriſt,</hi> he hath onely the evidence of his ſenſes; and he hath the very ſame evidence to prove, <hi>that what he ſees in the Sacrament is not the body of Chriſt, but bread.</hi> So that here ariſeth a new controverſie, whether a man ſhould believe his ſenſes giving teſtimony againſt the Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, or bearing teſtimony to the Miracle which is wrought to confirm that Doctrine: For there is juſt the ſame evidence againſt the truth of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which there is for the truth of the Miracle. So that the Argument for Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, and the Objection againſt it, do juſt ballance one another; and where the weights in Both Scales are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, it is impoſſible that the one ſhould weigh down the other: and conſequently Tranſubſtantiation is not to be proved by a Miracle; for that would be, <hi>to prove to a man by ſomething that he ſees, that he does not ſee what he ſees.</hi>

            <p>And thus I have endeavoured, as briefly and clearly as I could, to give ſatisfaction to the <hi>firſt</hi> Enquiry I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>viz.</hi> How we may diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween true and counterfeit Revelations and Doctrines: I proceed now to the</p>

And this is an enquiry of no ſmall Importance; becauſe it is one of the moſt fundamental Points in difference between Us and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in many particular Controverſies, as concerning <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in one kind, the Service of God in an unknown Tongue;</hi> the buſineſs of <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,</hi> the <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Images,</hi> they are not able to offer any thing that is fit to move a reaſonable and conſiderate man; yet in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, concerning the Judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, they are not deſtitute of ſome ſpecious appearance of Reaſon which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be weighed and conſidered. Therefore that we may examine this

            <list>
               <item>1. Lay down ſome Cautions and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations whereby we may underſtand how far the generality of Chriſtians are allowed to judge in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</item>
               <item>2. I ſhall repreſent the grounds of this Principle.</item>
               <item>3. Endeavour to ſatisfie the main Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of our Adverſaries againſt it: And likewiſe to ſhew, that there is no ſuch reaſon and neceſſity for an univerſal infallible Judge as they pretend.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I. I ſhall lay down ſome Cautions and Limitations, by which we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how far the generality of Chriſtians are allowed to judge in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> Private Perſons are onely to judge for themſelves, and not to impoſe their Judgement upon others, as if they had any Authority over them. And this is reaſonable, becauſe if it were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, a Man would deprive others of that Liberty which he aſſumes to himſelf,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59936:45"/>and which he can claim upon no other account, but becauſe it belongs to others equally with himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This liberty of judging is not ſo to be underſtood as to take away the neceſſity and uſe of Guides and Teachers in Religion. Nor can this be denied to be a reaſonable limitation; becauſe the knowledge of Revealed Religion is not a thing born with us, nor ordinarily ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally infuſed into men; but is to be learned as other things are. And if it be to be learned, there muſt be ſome to teach and inſtruct others: And they that will learn, muſt be modeſt and humble; and in thoſe things, of which they are no competent Judges, they muſt give credit to their Teachers, and truſt their skill: For inſtance, every unlearned man is to take it upon the credit of thoſe who are skilfull, that the Scriptures are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfully tranſlated; and for the underſtanding of obſcure Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and more difficult points in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is to rely upon thoſe, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per buſineſs and employment it is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to the underſtanding of theſe things. For in theſe caſes every man is not capable of judging himſelf, and therefore he muſt neceſſarily truſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59936:45"/>And in all other things he ought to be modeſt; and unleſs it be in plain matters, which every man can judg of, he ought rather to diſtruſt himſelf than his Teacher.</p>
            <p>And this reſpect may be given to a Teacher without either ſuppoſing him to be infallibe, or making an abſolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of my judgment to him. A man may be a very able Teacher (ſuppoſe of the Mathematicks) and fit to have the reſpect which is due to a Teacher, tho he be not infallible in thoſe Sciences: and becauſe Infallibility is not neceſſary to ſuch a Teacher, it is neither neceſſary nor convenient that I ſhould abſolutely reſign up my Judgment to him. For though I have reaſon to credit him, within the compaſs of his Art, in things which I do not know, I am not therefore bound to believe him in things plainly contrary to what I and all mankind do certainly know. For example, if upon pretence of his skill in Arithmetick, which I am learning of him, he ſhould tell me, <hi>That twice two do not make four, but five;</hi> though I believed him to be the beſt Mathematician in the World, yet I cannot believe him in this thing: Nor is there reaſon I ſhould; becauſe I did not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59936:46"/>come to learn this of him, but knew as much of that before as he or any man elſe could tell me. The caſe is the ſame in matters of Religion; in which there are ſome things ſo plain, and lie ſo level to all capacities, that every man is almoſt equally judg of them: As I ſhall have occaſion farther to ſhew by and by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Neither does this liberty of judging, exempt men from a due ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and obedience to their Teachers and Governors. Every man is bound to obey the lawful Commands of his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors: and, what by publick conſent and Authority is determined and eſtabliſhed, ought not to be gainſaid by private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but upon very clear evidence of the falſhood or unlawfulneſs of it. And this is every mans duty, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Order, and out of regard to the Peace and Unity of the Church; which is not to be violated upon every ſcruple and frivolous pretence: And when men are perverſe and diſobedient, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is Judg, and may reſtrain and puniſh them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Nor do I ſo far extend this Liberty of judging in Religion, as to think every man fit to diſpute the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of Religion. A great part of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59936:46"/>people are ignorant, and of ſo mean ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity as not to be able to judge of the force of a very good Argument, much leſs of the iſſue of a long Diſpute; and ſuch perſons ought not to engage in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes of Religion; but to beg God's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and to rely upon their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and above all to live up to the plain dictates of natural Light, and the clear Commands of God's Word, and this will be their beſt ſecurity. And if the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God have placed them under ſuch Guides as do ſeduce them into Error, their Ignorance is invincible, and God will not condemn them for it, ſo long as they ſincerely endeavour to do the will of God ſo far as they know it. And this being the caſe of many, eſpecially in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where Ignorance is ſo induſtriouſly cheriſhed, I have ſo much charity as to hope well concerning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them: And ſeeing <hi>that</hi> Church teacheth and enjoins the people to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Images, it is in ſome ſenſe charitably done of them not to let them know the ſecond Commandment, that they may not be guilty of ſinning againſt ſo plain a Law. Having premiſed theſe Cautions, I proceed in the</p>
            <pb n="88" facs="tcp:59936:47"/>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. Place, To repreſent to you <hi>the grounds of this Principle of our Religion,</hi> viz. <hi>That we all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w private perſons to judge for themſelves in matters of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe many things in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eſpecially thoſe which are moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be believed and practiſed, are ſo plain that every man of ordinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, after competent inſtruction in matters of Religion (which is always to be ſuppoſed) can as well judge of them for himſelf, as any man or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of men in the world can judge for him. Becauſe in theſe he hath a plain Rule to go by, <hi>Natural Light</hi> and clear <hi>Revelation of Scripture.</hi> And this is no new Principle of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but moſt expreſly owned by the ancient <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Whatever things are neceſſary, are plain,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Chryſoſtom. All things are plainly contained in Scripture which concern faith and a good life,</hi> ſaith St <hi>Auſtin.</hi> And nothing can be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable than that thoſe things which are plain to every man ſhould be left to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man's judgment. For every man can judg of what is plain; of evident Truth and Falſhood, Virtue and Vice, of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Laws plainly delivered in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59936:47"/>Scripture, if we believe any thing to be ſo, which is next to madneſs to deny. I will refer it to no mans Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth to determine for me, <hi>Whether there be a God or not? Whether Murder and Perjury be Sins?</hi> Whether it be not plain in Scripture, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God,</hi> That <hi>he became man,</hi> and <hi>died for us,</hi> and <hi>roſe again?</hi> So that there is no need of a Judg in theſe caſes. Nor can I poſſibly believe any man to be ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely infallible, as not to call his infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility into queſtion, if he determines any thing contrary to what is plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all mankind. For if he ſhould determine <hi>that there is no God,</hi> or <hi>that he is not to be woſhipped,</hi> or <hi>that he will not puniſh and reward men,</hi> or, which is the caſe that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> puts, <hi>that Virtue is Vice, and Vice Virtue;</hi> he would hereby take away the very foundation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and how can I look upon him any longer as a Judg in matters of Religion, when there can be no ſuch thing as Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion if he have judged and determined right?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Scripture plainly allows this liberty to <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>private</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to judg for themſelves. And for this I need go no farther than my <hi>Text,</hi> which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59936:48"/>bids men <hi>try the Spirits whether they be of God.</hi> I do not think this is ſpoken only to the Pope or a General Council, but to Chriſtians in general; for to theſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> writes. Now if St. <hi>John</hi> had believed that God had conſtituted an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Judge in his Church, to whoſe Sentence and Determination all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are bound to ſubmit, he ought in all reaſon to have referred Chriſtians to him for the trial of Spirits, and not have left it to every man's private judgment to examine and to determine theſe things. But it ſeems St. <hi>Paul</hi> was likewiſe of the ſame mind; and though he was guided by an infallible Spirit, yet he did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that men ſhould blindly ſubmit to his Doctrine: Nay, ſo far is he from that, that he commends the <hi>Bereans</hi> for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing for which I dare ſay the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have check'd them moſt ſeverely, namely, for <hi>ſearching the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> to ſee <hi>whether thoſe things</hi> which the Apoſtles delivered <hi>were ſo</hi> or not: This liberty St. <hi>Paul</hi> allowed; and though he was inſpired by God, yet he treated thoſe whom he taught like men. And indeed, it were a hard caſe that a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of believing Divine Revelations, and rejecting Impoſtures, ſhould be impoſed
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59936:48"/>upon Chriſtians; and yet the liberty of judging, whether a Doctrine be from God or not, ſhould be taken away from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Our Adverſaries themſelves are forced to grant that which in effect is as much as we contend for. For though they deny a liberty of judging in <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular points</hi> of Religion, yet they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to grant men a liberty of judging upon the <hi>whole.</hi> When they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would perſwade a <hi>Jew,</hi> or a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> to become a Chriſtian; or a <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> (as they are pleaſed to call <hi>us</hi>) to come over to the Communion of their Church, and offer Arguments to induce them thereto; they do by this very thing, whether they will or no, make that man Judge <hi>which is the true Church,</hi> and <hi>the true Religion.</hi> Becauſe it would be ridiculous to perſwade a man to turn to their Religion, and to urge him with Reaſons to do ſo, and yet to deny him the uſe of his own judgement whether their Reaſons be ſufficient to move him to make ſuch a change. Now, as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> reaſons in another caſe, If men be fit to judge for themſelves in ſo great and important a matter as the choice of their Religion, why ſhould they be thought
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59936:49"/>
               <hi>unworthy to judge in leſſer matters?</hi> They tell us indeed that a man may uſe his judgement in the choice of his Religion; but when he hath once choſen, he is then for ever to reſign up his judgment to their Church: But what tolerable reaſon can any man give, why a man ſhould be fit to judge upon the <hi>whole,</hi> and yet unfit to judge upon <hi>particular</hi> Points? eſpecially if it be conſidered, that no man can make a diſcreet judgment of any Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath examined the particular Doctrines of it, and made a judgment concerning <hi>them.</hi> Is it credible, that God ſhould give a man judgment in the moſt fundamental and important matter of all, viz. <hi>To diſcern the true Religion,</hi> and <hi>the true Church, from the falſe;</hi> for no other end, but to enable him to chuſe once for all to whom he ſhould reſign and inſlave his judgment for ever? which is juſt as reaſonable as if one ſhould ſay, That God hath given a man eyes for no other end, but to look out once for all, and to pitch upon a diſcreet perſon to lead him about blindfold all the days of his life. I come now to the</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> III. Thing I propounded, which is, <hi>To Anſwer the main Objection of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59936:49"/>againſt this Principle;</hi> and likewiſe to ſhew that there is no ſuch Reaſon and neceſſity for an univerſal Inſallible Judge, as they pretend. Now their great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is this, If every man may judge for himſelf, there will be nothing but confuſion in Religion, there will be no end of Controverſies: ſo that an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal infallible Judge is neceſſary, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this God had not made ſufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the aſſurance of men's Faith, and for the Peace and unity of his Church: Or, as it is expreſſed in the <hi>Canon Law, aliter Dominus non videretur fuiſſe diſcretus, otherwiſe our Lord had not ſeem'd to be diſcreet.</hi> How plauſible ſoever this Objection may appear, I do not deſpair but if men will lay aſide pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and impartially conſider things, to make it abundantly evident, that this ground is not ſufficient to found an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Judge upon. And therefore in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it, I deſire theſe following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars may be conſidered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firft,</hi> That this which they ſay, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proves what God ſhould have done according to their fancy, than what he hath really and actually done. My <hi>Text</hi> expreſly bids Chriſtians to <hi>try the Spirits,</hi> which to any man's ſenſe does imply
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59936:50"/>that they may judge of theſe matters: But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſays they may not; becauſe if this liberty were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, God had not ordered things wiſely, and for the beſt, for the peace and unity of his Church. But, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays in another caſe, <hi>What art thou, O man, that objecteſt againſt God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If this reaſoning be good, we may as well conclude that there is an univerſal infallible Judge ſet over the whole world in all <hi>Temporal</hi> matters, to whoſe Authority all mankind is bound to ſubmit. Becauſe this is as neceſſary to the peace of the World, as the other is to the peace of the Church. And men ſurely are every whit as apt to be obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and perverſe about matters of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Right, as about matters of Faith. But it is evident in fact and experience that there is no ſuch univerſal Judge, appointed by God over the whole World, to decide all Caſes of temporal Right; and for want of him the World is fain to ſhift as well as it can. But now a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acute and ſcholaſtical man that would argue that God muſt needs have done whatever he fancies convenient for the World ſhould be done, might by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame way of Reaſoning conclude the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59936:50"/>neceſſity of an univerſal infallible Judge in Civil matters, as well as in matters of Religion: And their <hi>aliter Dominus non vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur fuiſſe diſcretus, otherwiſe God had not ſeem'd to be diſcreet,</hi> is every whit as cogent and as civil, in the one Caſe as the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is no need of ſuch a Judge, to aſſure men in matters of Religion; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men be ſufficiently certain without him. I hope it may be certain and clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough <hi>That there is a God;</hi> and <hi>That his Providence governs the World;</hi> and <hi>That there is another Life after this,</hi> though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pope nor Council had ever declared any thing about theſe matters. And for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Doctrines, we may be certain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of all that is neceſſary, if it be true which the <hi>Fathers</hi> tell us, <hi>That all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary are plainly revealed in the Holy Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> An infallible Judge, if there were one, is no certain way to end Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and to preſerve the unity of the Church; unleſs it were likewiſe infallibly certain, <hi>That there is ſuch a Judge,</hi> and, <hi>Who he is.</hi> For till men were ſure of both theſe, there would ſtill be a Controverſy, whether there be an infallible Judge, and who he is. And if it be true which they tell us, <hi>That without an infallible Judge Controverſies
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59936:51"/>cannot be ended,</hi> then a Controverſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning an infallible Judge can never be ended. And there are <hi>two</hi> Controverſies actually on foot about an infallible Judge; One, <hi>Whether there be an infallible Judge or not?</hi> which is a Controverſie between Us and the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and the other, <hi>Who this infallible Judge is?</hi> which is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie among themſelves, which could never yet be decided: And yet till it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, Infallibility, if they had it, would be of no uſe to them for the ending of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> There is no ſuch abſolute need, as is pretended, of determining all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies in Religion. If men would deveſt themſelves of prejudice and intereſt, as they ought, in matters of Religion, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary things of Religion are plain enough, and men would generally agree well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough about them: But if men will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be by aſſed by theſe, they would not hearken to an infallible Judge, if there were one; or they would find out ſome way or other to call his Infallibility into queſtion. And as for doubtful and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer matters in Religion, charity and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al forbearance among Chriſtians would make the Church as peaceable and happy, as perhaps it was ever deſign'd to be in this
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59936:51"/>World, without abſolute unity in Opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Whatever may be the inconveniences of mens judging for themſelves in Religion, yet taking this Principle with the Cautions I have given, I doubt not to make it appear, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences are far the leaſt on that ſide. The preſent condition of humane Nature doth not admit of any conſtitution of things, whether in Religion or Civil mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which is free from all kind of excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and inconvenience: That is the beſt ſtate of things which is liable to the leaſt and feweſt. If men be modeſt, and humble, and willing to learn, God hath done that which is ſufficient for the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Faith, and for the peace of his Church, without an infallible Judge: And if men will not be ſo, I cannot tell what would be ſufficient. I am ſure there were Hereſies and Schiſms in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Times, when Thoſe who governed the Church were certainly guided by an infallible Spirit. God hath appointed Guides and Teachers for us in matters of Religion, and if we will be contented to be inſtructed by them in thoſe neceſſary Articles and Duties of Religion, which are plainly contained in Scripture; and to be counſelled and directed by them
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59936:52"/>in things that are more doubtful and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, I do not ſee why we might hot do well enough without any infallible Judge or Guide.</p>
            <p>But ſtill it will be ſaid, Who ſhall judge what things are plain and what doubtful? The anſwer to this, in my opinion, is not difficult. For if there be any thing plain in Religion, every man that hath been duly inſtructed in the Principles of Religtion can judge of it, or elſe it is not plain. But there are ſome things in Religion ſo very plain, that no Guide or Judge can in reaſon claim that Authority over men, as to oblige them to believe or do the contrary; no, though he pretend to Infallibility; no, though he were an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> though he were an <hi>Angel from heaven.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> puts the caſe ſo high, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Though we, or an Angel from heaven, preach any other Goſpel unto you than what you have received, let him be accurſed:</hi> which plainly ſuppoſeth that Chriſtians may and can judge when Doctrines are contrary to the Goſpel. What? not believe an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> nor <hi>an Angel from heaven,</hi> if he ſhould teach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing evidently contrary to the plain Doctrine of the Goſpel? If he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine Vertue to be Vice, and Vice to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59936:52"/>be Vertue? No; not an Apoſtle, nor an Angel; becauſe ſuch a Doctrine as this would confound and overturn all things in Religion. And yet <hi>Bellarmin</hi> puts this very Caſe, and ſays, If the Pope ſhould ſo determine, <hi>we were bound to believe him, unleſs we would ſin againſt Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will conclude this Diſcourſe by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a very plain and familiar Caſe; by which it will appear what credit and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is fit to be given to a Guide, and what not. Suppoſe I came a Stranger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> and landing at <hi>Dover</hi> took a Guide there to conduct me in my way to <hi>York,</hi> which I knew before by the <hi>Mapp</hi> to lie <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Dover:</hi> having commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ſelf to him, if he lead me for two or three days together out of any plain Road, and many times over hedge and ditch, I cannot but think it ſtrange, that in a civil and well inhabited Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try there ſhould be no High-ways from one part of it to another: Yet thus far I ſubmit to him, though not without ſome regret and impatience. But then if after this, for two or three days more he lead me directly <hi>South,</hi> and with my face full upon the Sun at noon day, and at laſt bring me back again to <hi>Dover
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59936:53"/>Pere;</hi> and ſtill bids me follow him: Then certainly no modeſty do's oblige a man not to diſpute with his Guide, and to tell him ſurely that can be no way becauſe it is <hi>Sea.</hi> Now though he ſet never ſo bold a face upon the matter, and tell me with all the gravity and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the world, That it is not <hi>the Sea</hi> but <hi>dry Land</hi> under the <hi>ſpecies</hi> and <hi>appearance of Water;</hi> and that whatever my eyes tell me, having once commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ſelf to his guidance, I muſt not truſt my own ſenſes in the caſe; it being one of the moſt dangerous ſorts of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity for a man to believe his own eyes rather than his <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>infallible Guide:</hi> All this moves me not; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to expoſtulate roundly with him, and to let him underſtand that if I muſt not believe what I ſee, he is like to be of no farther uſe to me; becauſe I ſhall not be able, at this rate, to know whether I have a Guide, and whether I follow him or not. In ſhort, I tell him plainly, that when I took him for my Guide, I did not take him to tell me the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> between a <hi>Hedge</hi> and a <hi>High-way,</hi> between <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>dry Land;</hi> all this I knew before, as well as he or any man elſe could tell me; but I
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59936:53"/>took him to conduct and direct me the neareſt way to <hi>York:</hi> And therefore after all his impertinent talk; after all his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Credibility to perſwade me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, and all his confident <hi>ſayings,</hi> which he gravely calls <hi>Demonſtrations,</hi> I ſtand ſtifly upon the ſhore, and leave my learned and reverend Guide to take his own courſe, and to diſpoſe of himſelf as he pleaſeth; but firmly reſolved not to follow him. And is any man to be blamed that breaks with his Guide upon theſe Terms?</p>
            <p>And this is truly the Caſe, when a man commits himſelf to the Guidance of any Perſon or Church: If by virtue of this Authority, they will needs perſwade me out of my ſenſes, and not to believe <hi>what I ſee,</hi> but <hi>what they ſay; that Vertue is Vice, and Vice Vertue,</hi> it they declare them to be ſo: And that becauſe they ſay they are Infallible, I am to receive all their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates for Oracles, tho never ſo evidently falſe and abſurd in the Judgment of all Mankind: In this caſe there is no way to be rid of theſe unreaſonable People, but to deſire of them, ſince one kindneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves another, and all Contradictions are alike eaſie to be believed, that <hi>they</hi> would be pleaſed to believe that Infidelity is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59936:54"/>Faith, and that when I abſolutely renounce their Authority, I do yield a moſt perfect ſubmiſſion and obedience to it.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, all the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of God, as well as the Laws of men, go upon this preſumption, that men are not ſtark fools; but that they will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Intereſt and have ſome regard to the great concernment of their eternal ſalvation. And this is as much to ſecure men from miſtake in matters of Belief, as God hath afforded to keep men from ſin in matters of Practice. He hath made no effectual and infallible proviſion that men ſhall not ſin; and yet it would puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle any man to give a good Reaſon, why God ſhould take more care to ſecure men againſt Errors in belief, than againſt ſin and wickedneſs in their Lives.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now only draw <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences from this Diſcourſe which I have made, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is every mans Duty who hath ability and capacity for it, to endeavour to underſtand the grounds of his Religion.</hi> For to try Doctrines is to inquire into the grounds and reaſons of them; which the better any man underſtands, the more firmly he will be eſtabliſhed in the Truth, and be the more reſolute in the day of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59936:54"/>Trial, and the better able to withſtand the Arts and aſſaults of cunning Adverſaries, and the fierce ſtorms of Perſecution. And on the contrary, that man will ſoon be moved from his ſtedfaſtneſs who never examined the Grounds and Reaſons of his belief. When it comes to the Trial, he that hath but little to ſay for his Religion will probably neither do nor ſuffer much for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That all Doctrines are vehemently to be ſuſpected which decline Trial,</hi> and are ſo loath to be brought into the light; which will hot endure a fair Examination, but magiſterially require an implicite Faith: Whereas Truth is bold and full of courage, and loves to appear openly; and is ſo ſecure and confident of her own ſtrength as to offer her ſelf to the ſevereſt Trial and Examination. But to deny all liberty of Enquiry and Judgment in matters of Religion is the greateſt injury and diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to Truth that can be, and a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite acknowledgment that ſhe lies under ſome diſadvantage, and that there is leſs to be ſaid for her than for Error.</p>
            <p>I have often wonder'd why the People in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do not ſuſpect their Teachers and Guides to have ſome ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign upon them, when they do ſo induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59936:55"/>debar them of the means of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and are ſo very loath to let them underſtand what it is that we have to ſay againſt their Religion. For can any thing in the world be more ſuſpicious than to perſwade men, to put out their eyes, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on promiſe that they will help them to a much better and more faithful Guide? If any Church, any Profeſſion of men, be unwilling their Doctrines ſhould be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Trial, it is a certain ſign they know ſomething by them that is faulty, and which will not endure the light. This is the account which our Saviour gives us in a like caſe, It was <hi>becauſe mens deeds were evil</hi> that <hi>they loved darkneſs rather than light.</hi> For <hi>every one that doth evil hateth the light; neither cometh he to the light lest his deeds ſhould be reproved: But he that doth the truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt that they are wrought in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Since Reaſon and Chriſtianity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this liberty to private perſons to judg for themſelves in matters of Religion, we ſhould uſe this priviledg with much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and humility, with great ſubmiſſion and deference to our Spiritual Rulers and Guides, whom God hath appointed in his Church. And there is very great need of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59936:55"/>this Caution, ſince by experience we find this liberty ſo much abuſed by many to the nouriſhing of Pride and Self-conceit, of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion and Faction; and thoſe who are leaſt able to judge, to be frequently the moſt forward and confident, the moſt peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and perverſe: and inſtead of demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themſelves with the ſubmiſſion of Learners, to aſſume to themſelves the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Judges, even in the moſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and diſputable matters.</p>
            <p>The Tyranny of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Minds and Conſciences of men is not to be juſtified upon any account; but nothing puts ſo plauſible a colour upon it, as the ill uſe that is too frequently made of this natural Privilege of mens judging for themſelves in a matter of ſo infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, as that of their eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But then it is to be conſider'd, that the proper remedy in this Caſe, is not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive men of this Privelege, but to uſe the beſt means to prevent the abuſe of it. For though the <hi>inconveniences</hi> ariſing from the ill uſe of it may be very great, yet the <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief</hi> on the other hand is intolerable. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it ſelf is liable to be abuſed to very bad purpoſes, and frequently is ſo; but it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not therefore beſt that there ſhould be no Religion: And yet this Objection, if it be of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59936:56"/>any force and be purſued home, is every whit as ſtrong againſt Religion it ſelf, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mens liberty of judging in matters of Religion. Nay I add farther, that no man can judiciouſly embrace the true Religion, unleſs he be permitted to judge, whether that which he embraces be the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or not.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When upon due Trial and: Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we are well ſetled and eſtabliſhed in our Religion, <hi>let us hold faſt the proſeſſion of our Faith without wavering;</hi> and not be <hi>like Children, toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine, through, the ſleight of men, and the cunning craftineſs of thoſe who lye in wait to deceive.</hi> And above all, let us reſolve to live according to the excellent Rules and Precepts of our holy Religion; let us heartily obey that Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which we profeſs to believe. We, who enjoy the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, have all the means and advantages of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Will of God, free liberty and full ſcope of enquiring into it, and informing our ſelves concerning it: We have all the opportunities we can wiſh of coming to the knowledge of our Duty: The Oracles of God lie open to us, and his Law is continually before our eyes; <hi>his word is nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, in our mouths, and in our hearts;</hi> (that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59936:56"/>is, we may read it and meditate upon it) <hi>that we may do it: The Key of Knowledge is</hi> put into our hands, ſo that if we do not <hi>enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> it is we our ſelves that ſhut our ſelves out. And where there is nothing to hinder us from the knowledge of our Duty, there certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing can excuſe us from the practice of it. For the End of all knowledge is to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect men in their duty, and effectually to engage them to the performance of it:The great buſineſs of Religion is, <hi>to make men tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good,</hi> and <hi>to teach them to live well.</hi> And if Religion have not this effect, it matters not of what Church any man liſts and enters himſelf; for moſt certainly, <hi>A bad man can be ſaved in none.</hi> Though a man know the right way to Heaven never ſo well, and be entred into it, yet if he will not walk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he ſhall never come thither: Nay, it will be an aggravation of this man's unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he was loſt in the way to Heaven, and periſhed in the very road to Salvation. But if we will in good earneſt apply our ſelves to the practice of Religion, and the obedience of God's holy Laws, his Grace will never be wanting to us to ſo good a purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I have not time to recommend Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to you at large, with all its advantages.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59936:57"/>I will compriſe what I have to ſay in a few words, and mind them at your peril. Let that which is our great concernment be our great care, <hi>To know the Truth and to do it, To fear God and keep his Commandments.</hi> Conſidering the Reaſonableneſs and the Reward of Piety arid Vertue, nothing can be wiſer; and conſidering the mighty aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of God's Grace, which he is ready to afford to us, and the unſpeakable ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and delight which is to be had in the doing of our duty, nothing can be eaſier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nothing will give us that pleaſure, while we live; nothing can miniſter that true and ſolid comfort to us, when we come to die: There is probably no ſuch way for a man to be happy in this World; to be ſure, there is no way but this to eſcape the intolerable and endleſs miſeries of another World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now God grant that we may all know, and do in this our day, the things that belong to our peace, for his Mercies ſake in Jeſus Chriſt; To whom with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt be all Honour and Glory now and for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

               <p>THE Neceſſity of Religion to the ſupport of humane Society in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appears more evidently than in this,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59936:60"/>That the obligation of an Oath, which is ſo neceſſary for the maintenance of peace and juſtice among men, depends wholly upon the ſence and belief of a Deity. For no reaſon can be imagined why any man that doth not believe a God, ſhould make the leaſt conſcience of an Oath; which is nothing elſe but a ſolemn appeal to God as a witneſs of the truth of what we ſay. So that whoever promotes Atheiſm and Infidelity doth the moſt deſtructive thing imaginable to human Society, becauſe he takes away the reverence and obligation of Oaths: And whenever that is generally caſt off, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Society muſt disband, and all things run into diſorder. The juſt ſenſe whereof made <hi>David</hi> cry out to God with ſo much earneſtneſs, as if the World had been cracking, and the frame of it ready to break in pieces, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. <hi>Help, Lord, for the righteous man ceaſeth, and the faithful fail from among the children of men:</hi> Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, That when Faith fails from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, nothing but a particular and immediate interpoſition of the Divine Providence can preſerve the World from falling into confuſion. And our Bleſſed Saviour gives this as a ſign of the end of the Wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, and the approaching diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59936:60"/>of all things, when faith and truth ſhall hardly be found among men, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.8. <hi>When the Son of man comes, ſhall he find Faith on the earth?</hi> This ſtate of things doth loudly call for his coming to deſtroy the World, which is even ready to diſſolve and fall in pieces of it ſelf when theſe bands and pillars of humane Society do break and fail. And ſurely never in any age was this ſign of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Son of man more glaring and terrible than in this degenerate Age wherein we live, when almoſt all ſorts of men ſeem to have broke looſe from all obligations to faith and truth.</p>
               <p>And therefore I do not know any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument more proper and uſeful to be treated of upon this Occaſion than of the Nature and Obligation of an <hi>Oath,</hi> which is the utmoſt ſecurity that one man can give to another of the truth of what he ſays; the ſtrongeſt tye of fideility, the ſureſt ground of Judicial proceedings, and the moſt firm and ſacred bond that can be laid upon all that are concerned in the adminiſtration of publick Juſtice; upon <hi>Judge,</hi> and <hi>Jury,</hi> and <hi>Witneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for this reaſon I have pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Words; In which the Apoſtle declares to us the great uſe and neceſſity
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59936:61"/>of Oaths among men; <hi>an Oath for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation is to them an end of all ſtrife.</hi> He had ſaid before, that for our greater aſſurance and comfort God hath confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his promiſes to us by an Oath; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending herein to deal with us after the manner of men, who when they would give credit to a doubtful matter confirm what they ſay by an Oath. And generally when any doubt or controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ariſeth between Parties concerning a matter of fact, one ſide affirming and the other denying, an end is put to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt by an Oath, <hi>An Oath for confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being to them an end of all ſtrife: An Oath for confirmation,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for the greater aſſurance and eſtabliſhment of a thing: Not that an Oath is always a certain and infallible deciſion of things according to truth and right, but that this is the utmoſt credit that we can give to any thing, and the laſt reſort of truth and confidence among men: After this we can go no farther, for if the Religion of an Oath will not oblige men to ſpeak truth nothing will. This is the utmoſt ſecutity that men can give, and muſt therefore be the final deciſion of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts; <hi>An Oath for confirmation is to them an end of all ſtrife.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:59936:61"/>
               <p>Now from this aſſertion of the Apoſtle concerning the great uſe and end of Oaths among men, I ſhall take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To conſider the <hi>nature</hi> of an Oath, and the <hi>kinds</hi> of it.</item>
                  <item>2. To ſhew the great <hi>uſe</hi> and even <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> of Oaths, in many caſes.</item>
                  <item>3. To vindicate the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> of them, where they are neceſſary.</item>
                  <item>4. To ſhew the ſacred <hi>obligation</hi> of an Oath. I ſhall be as brief in theſe as the juſt handling of them will bear.</item>

               <p n="1">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I. For the <hi>nature</hi> of an Oath, and the <hi>kinds</hi> of it. An <hi>Oath is an invocation of God, or an appeal to him as a witneſs of the truth of what we ſay.</hi> So that an Oath is a ſacred thing, as being an act of Religion and an invocation of the Name of God: And this, whether the Name of God be expreſly mentioned in it or not. If a man only ſay, <hi>I ſwear,</hi> or <hi>I take my Oath,</hi> that a thing is, or is not, ſo, or ſo; or that I will, or will not, do ſuch a thing: Or if a man <hi>anſwer upon his Oath,</hi> being adjured and required ſo to do: Or if a man <hi>ſwear by Heaven, or by Earth,</hi> or by any other thing that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59936:62"/>hath relation to God; in all theſe caſes a man doth virtually call God to witneſs; and in ſo doing he doth by conſequence invoke him as a Judge and an Avenger, in caſe what he ſwears be not true: And if this be expreſt, the Oath is a formal Imprecation; but whether it be, or not, a curſe upon our ſelves is always implied in caſe of perjury.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>two</hi> ſorts of Oaths, <hi>Aſſerto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and <hi>Promiſſory.</hi> An <hi>aſſertory</hi> Oath is when a man affirms or denies upon oath a matter of fact, paſt, or preſent: When he ſwears that a thing was, or is ſo, or not ſo. A <hi>promiſſory</hi> Oath is a promiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by an Oath, which always reſpects ſomething that is future: And if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe be made directly and immediately to <hi>God,</hi> then it is called a <hi>Vow;</hi> if to <hi>men,</hi> an <hi>Oath.</hi> I proceed to the</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. Thing, which is to ſhew the great <hi>uſe</hi> and even <hi>neceſſity</hi> of Oaths, in many caſes: Which is ſo great, that humane Society can very hardly, if at all, ſubſiſt long without them. Government would many times be very inſecure, and for the faithful diſcharge of Offices of great truſt, in which the welfare of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is nearly concerned, it is not poſſible
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59936:62"/>to find any ſecurity equal to that of an Oath; becauſe the obligation of that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to the moſt ſecret and hidden pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of men, and takes hold of them in many caſes where the penalty of no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law can have any awe or force up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: And eſpecially, it is (as the <hi>Civil Law</hi> expreſſeth it) <hi>maximum expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diendarum litium remedium,</hi> the beſt means of ending controverſies: And where mens eſtates or lives are concerned, no evidence but what is aſſured by an Oath will be thought ſufficient to decide the matter, ſo as to give full and general ſatisfaction to mankind. For in matters of ſo great concernment, when men have all the aſſurance that can be had, and not till then, they are contented to ſit down and reſt ſatisfied with it. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Nations an Oath hath always been thought the only peremptory and ſatisfactory way of deciding ſuch contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> III. The <hi>third</hi> thing I propoſed was to vindicate the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> of Oaths, where they are neceſſary. And it is a very ſtrong inducement to believe the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them, that the unavoidable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of humane affairs hath made them
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59936:63"/>ſo neceſſary. The Apoſtle takes it for granted that an Oath is not only of great uſe in humane affairs, but in many caſes of great neceſſity, to confirm a doubtful thing, and to put an end to controverſies which cannot otherwiſe be decided to the ſatisfaction of the Parties contending; <hi>An oath for confirmation is to them an end of all ſtrife</hi> And indeed it is hardly imaginable that God ſhould not have left that lawful, which is ſo evidently neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the peace and ſecurity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>But becauſe there is a <hi>Sect,</hi> ſprung up in our memory, which hath called in queſtion the lawfulneſs of all Oaths, to the great miſchief and diſturbance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society, I ſhall endeavour to ſearch this matter to the bottom, and to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt how unreaſonable and groundleſs this Opinion is. And to this end, I ſhall</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Prove the lawfulneſs of Oaths from the authority of this Text, and from the reaſons plainly contained, or ſtrongly implied in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew the weakneſs and inſufficiency of the grounds of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinion; whether from Reaſon, or from Scripture, which laſt they prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally rely upon; and if it could be
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59936:63"/>made out from thence would determine the caſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall prove the lawfulneſs of Oaths from the authority of this Text, and the reaſons plainly contained, or ſtrongly implied in it. Becauſe the Apoſtle doth not only ſpeak of the uſe of Oaths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men without any manner of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and reproof, but as a commendable cuſtom and practice, and in many caſes neceſſary for the confirmation of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful matters, and in order to the final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Controverſies and Differences among men. For</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He ſpeaks of it as the general practice of Mankind, to confirm things by an oath in order to the ending of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences. And indeed there is nothing that hath more univerſally obtained in all Ages and Nations of the World: than which there is not a more certain indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that a thing is agreeable to the Law of Nature and the beſt Reaſon of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And that this was no degenerate practice of Mankind, like that of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is from hence evident; that when God ſeparated a People to himſelf, it was practiſed among them, by the holy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> and was afterwards not only allowed;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59936:64"/>but in many Caſes commanded by the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> which had it been a thing evil in it ſelf and forbidden by the Law of Nature, would not have been done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> Another undeniable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Text of the lawfulneſs of Oaths is, that God himſelf, in condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Cuſtome of men who uſe to confirm and give credit to what they ſay by an Oath, is repreſented by the Apoſtle as confirming his promiſe to us by an Oath, verſe 13. <hi>When God made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to Abraham, becauſe he could ſwear by none greater, he ſwears by himſelf. For men verily ſwear by the greater; and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all ſtrife. Wherein God, willing more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly to ſhew unto the heirs of promiſe the immutability of his counſel, confirmed it by an oath:</hi> which he certainly would not have done, had an oath been unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in it ſelf. For that had been to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with men in an evil practice, and by his own example to give countenance to it in the higheſt manner: But though God condeſcend to repreſent himſelf to us after the manner of men, he never does it in any thing that is in its own nature evil and ſinful.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:59936:64"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From the great Uſefulneſs of Oaths in humane affairs, to give credit and confirmation to our word, and to put an end to Conteſtations. Now that which ſerves to ſuch excellent purpoſes, and is ſo convenient for humane ſociety, and for mutual ſecurity and confidence among men, ought not eaſily to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed unlawful, till it be plainly proved to be ſo. And if we conſider the nature of an oath, and every thing belonging to it, there is nothing that hath the leaſt appearance of evil in it. There is ſurely no evil in it, as it is an act of Religion; nor as it is an Appeal to God as a witneſs and avenger in caſe we ſwear falſly; nor as it is a confirmation of a doubtful mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; nor as it puts an end to ſtrife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie. And theſe are all the eſſential in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of an Oath, and the ends of it; and they are all ſo good, that they rather commend it, than give the leaſt colour of ground to condemn it. I proceed in the</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second</hi> place, to ſhew the weakneſs and inſufficiency of the grounds of the contrary opinion; whether from <hi>Reaſon</hi> or from <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> from <hi>Reaſon.</hi> They ſay the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of an Oath is occaſioned by the want of truth and fidelity among men.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59936:65"/>And that every man ought to demean himſelf with that faithfulneſs and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity as may give credit and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his word; and then Oaths will be needleſs. This pretence will be fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, if we conſider theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in matters of great importance no other obligation, beſides that of an oath, hath been thought ſufficient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the beſt and wiſeſt of men to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert their fidelity to one another. <hi>Even the beſt men</hi> (to uſe the words of a great Author) <hi>have not trusted the beſt men without it.</hi> As we ſee in very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtances, where Oaths have paſs'd between thoſe who might be thought to have the greateſt confidence in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: As between <hi>Abraham</hi> and his old faithful ſervant <hi>Eliezer,</hi> concerning the choice of a Wife for his Son: Between Father and Son, <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the burial of his Father in the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> Between two of the deareſt and moſt intimate Friends, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> to aſſure their friendſhip to one another; and it had its effect long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Jonathans</hi> death in the ſaving of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiboſheth,</hi> when reaſon of State and the ſecurity of his Throne ſeem'd to move <hi>David</hi> ſtrongly to the contrary; for it is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59936:65"/>expreſly ſaid, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.7. that <hi>David</hi> ſpared <hi>Mephiboſheth, Jonathan's Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the oath of the Lord that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them;</hi> implying, that had it not been for his Oath, other conſiderations might probably have prevail'd with him to have permitted him to have been cut off with the reſt of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Children.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Reaſon, which is alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Oaths among men, is much ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er againſt God's confirming his promiſes to us by an Oath. For he who is truth it ſelf is ſurely of all other moſt to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited upon his bare word, and his oath needleſs to give confirmation to it; and yet he condeſcends to add his oath to his word; and therefore that reaſon is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of no force.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> From <hi>Scripture.</hi> Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſeems altogether to forbid ſwearing in any caſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.33, 34. <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid to them of old time, thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf: but I ſay unto you ſwear not at all; neither by heaven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But let your communication be yea, yea, and nay, nay; for whatſoever is more than theſe cometh of evil.</hi> And this Law St. <hi>James</hi> recites, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. as that which Chriſtians ought to have a very particular and principal regard to;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59936:66"/>
                  <hi>above all things my brethren ſwear not:</hi> And he makes the breach of this Law a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſin, <hi>leſt ye fall into condemnation.</hi> But the authority of our Saviour alone is ſufficient, and therefore I ſhall only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that Text.</p>
               <p>And, becauſe here lies the main ſtrength of this opinion of the unlawfulneſs of Oaths, it is very fit that this Text be fully conſider'd; and that it be made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evident, that it was not our Saviour's meaning by this prohibition wholly to forbid the uſe of Oaths.</p>
               <p>But before I enter upon this matter, I will readily grant, that there is ſcarce any Errour whatſoever that hath a more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible colour from Scripture, than this; which makes the caſe of thoſe who are ſeduced into it the more pityable: But then it ought to be conſider'd, how much this Doctrine of the unlawfulneſs of oaths reflects upon the Chriſtian Religion: ſince it is ſo evidently prejudicial both to humane Society in general, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to thoſe perſons that entertain it: neither of which ought raſhly to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and taken for granted, concerning any Law delivered by our Saviour: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe upon theſe terms it will be very hard for us to vindicate the divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59936:66"/>of our Saviour's Doctrine, and the Reaſonableneſs of the Chriſtian Religion. Of the inconvenience of this Doctrine to humane Society, I have ſpoken alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But beſides this, it is very prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to them that hold it. It renders them ſuſpected to Government, and in many caſes incapable of the common benefits of Juſtice and other privileges of humane Society, and expoſeth, them to great penalties as the conſtitution of all Laws and Governments at preſent is, and it is not eaſie to imagine how they ſhould be otherwiſe. And which is very conſiderable in this matter, it ſets thoſe who refuſe Oaths upon very unequal terms with the reſt of Mankind, if where the eſtates and lives of men are equally concern'd, their bare teſtimonies ſhall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be admitted without an Oath, and others ſhall be obliged to ſpeak upon Oath: Nothing being more certain in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, than that many men will lie for their intereſt when they will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, God having planted in the natural Conſciences of men a ſecret dread of perjury above moſt other ſins. And this inconvenience is ſo great, as to render thoſe who refuſe oaths in all caſes almoſt intolerable to humane Society. I ſpeak
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59936:67"/>not this either to bring them into trouble, or to perſwade them to meaſure truth by their intereſt: but on the other hand I muſt needs ſay, that it is no Argument either of a wiſe or good man to take up any opinion, eſpecially ſuch a one as is greatly to his prejudice, upon ſlight grounds. And this very conſideration, that it is ſo much to their inconvenience, may juſtly move them to be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the examination of it.</p>
               <p>This being premis'd, I come now to explain this Prohibition of our Saviour; and to this purpoſe, I deſire theſe <hi>three</hi> things may be well conſider'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That ſeveral circumſtances of theſe words of our Saviour do manifeſtly ſhew that they ought to be interpreted in a limited ſenſe, as only forbidding ſwearing in common converſation; <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> and <hi>heedleſs</hi> oaths (as one expreſſeth it) and in general all voluntary ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unleſs upon ſome great and weighty cauſe, in which the glory of God and the good of the ſouls of Men is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For that in ſuch caſes a voluntary oath may be lawful, I am induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve from the example of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who uſeth it more than once upon ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; of which I ſhall hereafter give par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Inſtances.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:59936:67"/>
               <p>And this was the ſenſe of Wiſe men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Heathen,</hi> that men ſhould not ſwear but upon neceſſity and great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Thus <hi>Euſebius,</hi> the Philoſopher in <hi>Stobaeus,</hi> counſels men. <hi>Some</hi> (ſays he) <hi>adviſe men to be carefull to ſwear the truth; but I adviſe principally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that men do not eaſily ſwear at all,</hi> that is, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any ſlight but only upon weighty oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; To the ſame purpoſe <hi>Epictetus, Shun oaths wholly, if it be poſſible; if not, however as much as thou canſt:</hi> And ſo likewiſe <hi>Simplicius</hi> in his <hi>Comment</hi> upon him, <hi>We ought wholly to ſhun ſwearing, except upon occaſions of great neceſſity:</hi> And <hi>Quintilian</hi> among the <hi>Romans, In totum jurare, niſi ubi neceſſe eſt, gravi viro pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum convenit; To ſwear at all, except where it is neceſſary, do's not well ſuit with a wiſe man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, that this prohibition of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's ought to be underſtood of oaths in ordinary converſation, appears from the oppoſition which our Saviour makes, <hi>Swear not at all; but let your communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be yea, yea;</hi> That is, in your ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commerce and affairs do not interpoſe oaths, but ſay and do. And this is very much confirmed, in that our Saviour do's not under this general Prohibition, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59936:68"/>in ſuch oaths as are expreſly by the name of God: The reaſon whereof is this; The <hi>Jews</hi> thought it unlawfull in ordinary communication to ſwear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly by the name of God, but lawfull to ſwear by the Creatures, as by <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> &amp;c. So that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's meaning is as if he had ſaid, You think you may ſwear in common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation provided you do not ſwear by the name of God; but I ſay unto you, let your communication be without oaths of any kind: you ſhall not ſo much as ſwear by <hi>heaven</hi> or by <hi>earth,</hi> becauſe God is virtually invoked in every oath. And unleſs we ſuppoſe this to be our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's meaning, I do not ſee what good Reaſon can be given why our Saviour ſhould only forbid them to ſwear by the Creatures, and not much rather by the Name of God; ſuch oaths being ſurely of all others moſt to be avoided, as being the moſt direct abuſe and profanation of the Name of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is very conſiderable to the explaining of this Prohibition, that there are the like general expreſſions in other <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Authors concerning this very matter, which yet muſt of neceſſity be thus limited. <hi>Maimonides,</hi> from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59936:68"/>
                  <hi>Rabbies,</hi> gives this Rule, that <hi>it is beſt not to ſwear at all.</hi> And <hi>Philo</hi> uſeth almoſt the ſame words. And <hi>Rabbi Jonathan</hi> comes very near our Saviour's expreſſion, when he ſays <hi>The juſt man will not ſwear at all; not ſo much as by the common Names of God, nor by his Attributes, nor by his Works, as by Heaven, or the Angels, or the Law.</hi> Now it is not imaginable, that theſe learned <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould condemn Oaths in all caſes, when the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> did in many caſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly require them. And therefore they are to be underſtood of voluntary oaths in ordinary converſation. And that the <hi>Jews</hi> meant this by not ſwearing at all, ſeems to be very plain from a paſſage in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who ſays that the <hi>Sect</hi> of <hi>the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenes</hi> forbad their Diſciples to ſwear at all; and yet he tells us at the ſame time, that they who were admitted into that <hi>Sect</hi> took an oath to obſerve the Laws and Rules of it. So that they who forbad to ſwear at all, allowed of Oaths impoſed by the Authority of Superiours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Which will peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide this matter, this Prohibition of our Saviour's cannot be underſtood to forbid all Oaths, without a plain contradiction to the undoubted practice of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, and of the Apoſtles, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59936:69"/>even of our Lord himſelf. <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> tells us, that the Chriſtians refuſed to ſwear by the Emperor's <hi>Genius;</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was an Oath, but becauſe they thought it to be Idolatrous: But the ſame <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays, that the Chriſtians were willing to ſwear <hi>per ſalutem Imperatoris, by the health and ſafety of the Emperour. Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> being accuſed to <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> purged himſelf by oath, and deſired that his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer might be put to his Oath <hi>ſub atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatione veritatis, by calling the truth to witneſs;</hi> by which form (ſays he) <hi>we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are wont to ſwear.</hi> But which is more than this, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> upon weighty occaſions, do's ſeveral times in his <hi>Epiſtles</hi> call God to witneſs for the truth of what he ſays; which is the very formality of an Oath. <hi>God is my witneſs, Rom.</hi> 1.9. <hi>As God is true, our word was not yea and nay,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. and <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>I call God for a record upon my Soul. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God I lye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not, Gal,</hi> 1.20. <hi>God is my record, Philip</hi> 1.8. <hi>God is my witneſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.5. Theſe are all unqueſtionable oaths; which we cannot imagine St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, had they been directly contrary to our Saviour's Law. And whereas ſome defend this upon account of his extraordinary Inſpiration, I cannot poſſibly ſee how this mends the matter. For certainly it
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59936:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>is very inconvenient to ſay that they who were to teach the Precepts of Chriſt to others, did themſelves break them by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</p>
               <p>But I go yet farther, and ſhall urge an example beyond all exception.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour himſelf (who ſurely would not be the firſt example of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Laws) did not refuſe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer upon Oath, being called thereto at his Trial. So we find <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.63. <hi>Yhe high Prieſt ſaid unto him, I abjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Chriſt the Son of God;</hi> that is, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him to anſwer this queſtion upon Oath. For among the <hi>Jews,</hi> the form of giving an oath to witneſſes and others was not by tendering a formal oath to them, as the cuſtome is among us, but by adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, that is, requiring them to anſwer upon oath: As is plain from <hi>Levit.</hi> 5.1. <hi>If a man hear the voice of ſwearing, and is a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whether he hath ſeen or known of ſuch a thing, if he do not utter it, then he ſhall bear his Iniquity. If he have heard the voice if ſwearing,</hi> that is, if being adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or demanded to anſwer upon oath concerning what he hath ſeen or heard, he do not utter the truth, he is perjured. Now to this adjuration of the high Prieſt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59936:70"/>our Saviour anſwered, <hi>thou haſt ſaid:</hi> which words are not an avoiding to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer (as ſome have thought) but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect anſwer, as if he had ſaid <hi>it is as thou ſayeſt, it is even ſo, I am the Son of God.</hi> For upon this anſwer the high Prieſt ſaid, <hi>he hath ſpoken blaſphemy.</hi> But to put the matter beyond all doubt St. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.61. that he being asked by the high Prieſt, <hi>Art thou the Chriſt the Son of the Bleſſed? He anſwered, I am.</hi> So that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we will interpret our Saviour's Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine contrary to his own practice we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand him to forbid all Oaths, and conſequently they are not unlawfull.</p>
               <p>I have been the longer upon this, that I might give clear ſatisfaction in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to thoſe that are willing to receive it.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in uſe among us in the taking of Oaths, it is no juſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt them, that they are not found in Scripture. For this was always matter of liberty; and ſeveral Nations have uſed ſeveral Rites and Ceremonies in their Oaths. It was the cuſtome of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> to ſwear laying their hands upon the Altar, <hi>quod ſanctiſſimum jusju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum eſt habitum,</hi> (ſaith <hi>A. Gellius</hi>) <hi>which was looked upon as the moſt ſacred form of Swearing.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> were wont
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59936:70"/>
                  <hi>Jovem Lapidem jurare;</hi> that is, he that ſwore by <hi>Jupiter</hi> held a flint ſtone in his hand, and flung it violently from him with theſe words, <hi>Si ſciens fallo ita me Jupiter bonis omnibus ejiciat ut ego hunc Lapidem; If I knowingly falſify, God ſo throw me out of all my poſſeſſions as I do this stone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Scripture</hi> there are <hi>two</hi> Ceremonies mentioned of Swearing. <hi>One,</hi> of <hi>putting the hand under the Thigh</hi> of him to whom the Oath was <hi>made.</hi> Thus <hi>Eliezer</hi> ſwore to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 24. and <hi>Joſeph</hi> to <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 47. The <hi>other</hi> was <hi>by lifting up the hand to heaven:</hi> Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> expreſſeth the manner of an Oath, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.22. <hi>I have lift up my hand to the moſt high God.</hi> And thus God condeſcending to the manner of men, expreſſeth himſelf, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32, 40. <hi>If I lift up my hand to heaven, and ſwear.</hi> In alluſion to this cuſtome the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> deſcribes the perjured perſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.8. <hi>Whoſe mouth ſpeaketh vanity; and whoſe right hand is a right hand of falſhood.</hi> And there is not the leaſt intimation in Scripture that either of theſe Ceremonies were preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and appointed by God, but volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily inſtituted and taken up by men. And thus among us the Ceremony of Swearing is <hi>by laying the hand on the holy
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59936:71"/>Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>kiſſing the Book;</hi> which is both very ſolemn and ſignificant. And this is the reaſon why this ſolemn kind of Oath is called a <hi>corporal</hi> Oath, and was anciently ſo called; becauſe the ſign or ceremony of it is performed by ſome part of the <hi>Body.</hi> And this Solemnity is an aggravation of the Perjury, becauſe it makes it both more deliberate, and more ſcandalous.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſpeak but briefly to the</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> IV. And laſt particular, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſacred <hi>obligation</hi> of an Oath: becauſe it is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn appeal to God as a witneſs of the truth or what we ſay: To God, I ſay, from whoſe piercing and all-ſeeing eye, from whoſe perfect and infinite knowledge nothing is or can be hid: So that there is not a thought in our heart but he ſees it, nor a word in our tongue but he diſcerns the truth or falſhood of it. Whenever we ſwear we appeal to his knowledge, and refer our ſelves to his juſt judgment who is the powerfull Patron and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of Right, and the Almighty Judge and avenger of all falſhood and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. So that it is not poſſible for men to lay a more ſacred and ſolemn obligation upon their Conſciences, than by the Religion of an Oath. <hi>Moſes</hi> very
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59936:71"/>well expreſſeth it, by <hi>binding our ſouls with a bond.</hi> Numb. 30.2. <hi>If a man ſwear an oath, to bind his ſoul with a bond;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that he that ſwears lays the ſtrongeſt obligation upon himſelf, and puts his Soul in pawn for the truth of what he ſays. And this obligation no man can violate, but at the utmoſt peril of the judgment and vengeance of God. For every Oath implies a Curſe upon our ſelves in caſe of Perjury, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. And this was always the ſenſe of Mankind concerning the obligation of Oaths. <hi>Nullum vinculum ad aſtringendam fidem majores noſtri jurejurando arctius eſſe voluerunt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tully; Our fore-fathers had no ſtricter bond whereby to oblige the faith of men to one another, than that of an Oath.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe is that in the <hi>Comedian, Aliud ſi ſcirem, qui firmare me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am apud vos poſſem fidem, ſanctius quam jusjurandum, id pollicerer tibi. If I knew any thing more ſacred than an Oath, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to confirm to you the truth of what I ſay, I would make uſe of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will crave your patience a little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whilſt by way of inference from this Diſcourſe, I repreſent to you the great Sin of <hi>Swearing in common converſation,</hi> upon trivial and needleſs occaſions; and the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs of the ſin of <hi>Perjury.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:59936:72"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The great ſin of <hi>Swearing,</hi> upon trivial and needleſs occaſions, in common converſation. Becauſe an Oath is a ſolemn thing and reſerved for great occaſions, to give confirmation to our word in ſome weighty matter, and to put an end to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies which cannot otherwiſe be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily and ſatisfactorily decided. And therefore to uſe Oaths upon light occaſions argues great profaneneſs and irreverence of Almighty God. So <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> the great <hi>Roman</hi> Lawyer obſerves, <hi>Nonnullus eſſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles ad jurandum contemptu Religionis, that mens proneneſs to ſwearing comes from acon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Religion;</hi> than which nothing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth men more to Atheiſm and Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Beſides that it doth many times ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize men unawares into Perjury: And how can it be otherwiſe, when men uſe to interlard all their careleſs talk with Oaths, but that they muſt often be Perjur'd? And which is worſe, it prepares men for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate perjury: For with thoſe who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſwear upon light occaſions, an Oath will go off with them more roundly about weightier matters. <hi>From a common cuſtome of ſwearing</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>) <hi>men eaſily ſlide into perjury: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (ſays he) <hi>if thou wouldſt not he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, do not uſe to ſwear.</hi> And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59936:72"/>haps is the meaning of St. <hi>James,</hi> when he cautions Chriſtians ſo vehemently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt common ſwearing, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (for ſo ſome of the beſt ancient Copies read it) <hi>leſt ye fall into hypocriſie,</hi> that is, leſt ye lye and be perjured, by uſing your ſelves to raſh and inconſiderate ſwearing.</p>
               <p>And men expoſe themſelves to this danger to no purpoſe; Oaths in common diſcourſe being ſo far from confirming a man's word, that with wiſe men they much weaken it: For common ſwearing (if it have any ſerious meaning at all) argues in a man a perpetual diſtruſt of his own reputation, and is an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement that he thinks his bare word not to be worthy of credit. And it is ſo far from adorning and filling a man's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe that it makes it look ſwoln and bloated, and more bold and bluſtring than becomes perſons of gentle and good breeding. Beſides that it is a great inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, becauſe it highly offends and grates Upon all ſober and conſiderate perſons; who cannot be preſumed with any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of eaſe and patience to hear God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted, and his great and glorious Name ſo irreverently to ſtup one very ſlight occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:59936:73"/>
               <p>And it is no excuſe to men that many times they do it ignorantly, and not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and knowing what they do. For certainly it is no extenuation of a fault, that a man hath got the habit of it ſo perfect that he commits it when he does not think of it: Which conſideration ſhould make men oppoſe the beginnings of this Vice, leſt it grow into a habit very hard to be left. <hi>Nemo novit, niſi qui ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertus eſt, quam ſit difficile conſuetudinem jurandi extinguere,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin; No man knows, but he that hath tryed, how hard it is to get rid of this cuſtome of Swearing:</hi> But yet it is certain men may do it, by reſolution and great care of themſelves: For he that can chuſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will ſpeak or not, can chuſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will ſwear or not when he ſpeaks. Major <hi>conſuetudo majorem intentionem fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitat; The more inveterate a cuſtom is, the greater care ſhould be uſed to break our ſelves of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, This practice is ſo contrary to ſo plain a Precept of our Saviour, and by the breach whereof we incur ſo great a danger (as St. <hi>James</hi> aſſures us) that it muſt be a great charity that can find out a way to reconcile a common cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of ſwearing with a ſerious belief
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59936:73"/>of the Chriſtian Religion: Which I would to God thoſe who are concerned would ſeriouſly lay to heart. Eſpecially, ſince this Sin of all others hath the leaſt of Temptation to it. Profit or Pleaſure there is none in it, nor any thing in mens natural tempers to incite them to it. For tho ſome men pour out Oaths ſo freely as if they came naturally from them, yet ſurely no man is born of a ſwearing conſtitution.</p>
               <p>All that can be pretended for it, is Cuſtom and Faſhion: But to ſhew that this is no excuſe, it is very obſervable that it is particularly in the matter of Oaths and Perjury that the Holy Ghoſt gives that caution, <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly, it deſerves to be conſidered, that this ſin is ſo much the greater becauſe of the frequent returns of it in thoſe that are accuſtomed to it. So that altho it were but ſmall in it ſelf (as it is not) yet the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent practice of this ſin would quickly mount it up to a great ſcore.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To repreſent the heinouſneſs of the ſin of <hi>Perjury.</hi> But before I aggravate this Crime, it is fit to let men know how many ways they may be guilty of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. When a man aſſerts upon oath what he knows to be otherwiſe: Or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59936:74"/>what he does not intend to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. In both theſe caſes the very act of ſwearing is Perjury. And ſo likewiſe when a man promiſeth upon oath to do that which it is unlawfull for him to do becauſe this oath is contrary to a former obligation.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> When a man is uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what he ſwear to, be true. This likewiſe is Perjury, in the act; though not of the ſame degree of guilt with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, becauſe it is not ſo fully and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt his knowledge and conſcience. For men ought to be certain of the truth of what they aſſert upon oath, and not to ſwear at a venture. And therefore no man ought poſitively to ſwear to the truth of any thing but what he himſelf hath ſeen or heard: This being the higheſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance men are capable of in this World. In like manner, he is guilty of perjury in the ſame degree, who promiſeth upon oath what he is not morally and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably certain he ſhall be able to perform.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> They are likewiſe guilty of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, who do not uſe great plainneſs and ſimplicity in oaths; but anſwer <hi>aequivocally</hi> and doubtfully, or with reſervation of ſomething in their minds, thinking thereby to ſalve the truth of what they ſay. And we all know who they are
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59936:74"/>that make uſe of theſe arts, and maintain them to be lawfull; to the infinite ſcandal of the Chriſtian Religion and prejudice of humane Society, by doing what in them lies to deſtroy all Faith and mutual Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence among men. For what can be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er affront to God, than to uſe his Name to deceive men? And what can more directly overthrow the great end and uſe of oaths, which are <hi>for confirmation,</hi> and to <hi>put an end to Strife?</hi> Whereas by theſe arts the thing is left in the ſame uncertainty it was before, and there is no deciſion of it. For there is hardly any form of words can be deviſed ſo plain, as not to be lyable to Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation: To be ſure, a man when he ſwears may always reſerve ſomething in his mind which will quite alter the ſenſe of whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he can ſay or promiſe upon oath. And this may be laid down for a certain Rule, That all departure from the ſimplicity of an oath is a degree of Perjury, and a man is never a whit the leſs forſworn becauſe his perjury is a little finer and more artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial than ordinary. And though men think by this device to ſave themſelves harmleſs from the guilt of ſo great a Sin, they do real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſe it, by adding to their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the impudent folly of mocking God and deceiving themſelves.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:59936:75"/>
               <p>And whereas it is pleaded in the favour of <hi>mental reſervation,</hi> that the whole Propoſition, as made up of what is expreſt in words and of that which is reſerved in the mind, is true; For inſtance, if a man being ask'd upon Oath whether he be a Prieſt, ſhall anſwer he is not, reſerving in his mind that he is not a Prieſt of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> or ſome ſuch thing, the whole Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is true, and then they ſay a man may ſwear to that which is true, without danger of perjury: This is of no force, becauſe, though the whole propoſition be true, it is deceitfull, and contrary to that ſincerity which ought to be in an oath: And the end of an oath is hereby likewiſe defeated, which is to aſcertain the truth of what we ſay: But if a man reſerve ſomething in his mind which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the truth of what he ſays, the thing is ſtill as doubtfull and uncertain as it was before. Beſides, if this be a good reaſon, a man may ſwear with reſervation in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; becauſe the reaſon equally extends to all caſes; for if the truth of the propoſition, as made up of what is expreſs'd in words and reſerv'd in the mind, will excuſe a man from Perjury, then no man can be perjur'd that ſwears with reſervation: But this the <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59936:75"/>do not allow, but only in ſome particular caſes, as <hi>before an incompetent Judge,</hi> or the like; for they ſee well enough that if this were allow'd in all caſes, it would deſtroy all Faith among men. And therefore ſince the reaſon extends alike to all caſes, it is plain that it is to be allow'd in none.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> He is guilty of Perjury after the act, who having a real intention when he ſwears, to perform what he promiſeth, yet afterwards neglects to do it: Not for want of Power (for ſo long as that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues the obligation ceaſeth) but for want of Will, and due regard to his oath.</p>
               <p>Now that Perjury is a moſt heinous Sin, is evident, becauſe it is contrary to ſo plain and great a Law of God; one of the ten <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Precepts</hi> of the Moral Law, <hi>thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain;</hi> thou ſhalt not bring or apply the name of God to a falſhood: Or, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> renders it, <hi>Thou ſhalt not adjure God to a falſe thing:</hi> Which our <hi>Saviour</hi> renders yet more plainly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.33. <hi>Thou ſhalt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear thy ſelf.</hi> For he ſeems to refer to the <hi>third</hi> Commandment when he ſays, <hi>Ye have heard that it was ſaid to them of old time, thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf,</hi> as he had done before to the 6th. and 7th.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59936:76"/>when he ſays, <hi>It was ſaid to them of old time, thou ſhalt not kill, thou ſhalt not commit adultery.</hi> So that the primary, if not the ſole intention of this Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain,</hi> is to forbid the great ſin of Perjury. And I do not remember that in Scripture the phraſe of <hi>taking God's name in vain</hi> is uſed in any other ſenſe. And thus it is certainly uſed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.9. <hi>Leſt I be poor and ſteal, and take the name of the Lord my God in vain: i. e.</hi> leſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty ſhould tempt me to ſteal, and ſtealth ſhould engage me in Perjury. For among the <hi>Jews</hi> an oath was tendered to him that was ſuſpected of theft, as appears from <hi>Levit.</hi> 6.2. where it is ſaid, <hi>If any one be guilty of theft, and lyeth concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, or ſweareth falſly; he ſhall reſtore all that about which he hath ſworn falſly. Leſt I ſteal, and take the name of the Lord my God in vain;</hi> that is, be perjured, being exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon oath concerning, a thing ſtoln. And for this reaſon the thief and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured perſon are put together, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5.4. where it is ſaid, that <hi>a curſe ſhall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſe of the thief, and of him that ſweareth falſly by the name of God.</hi> From all which it is very probable, that the whole intention of the 3d. Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59936:76"/>is to forbid this great ſin of Perjury. To deter men from which, a ſevere threatning is there added; <hi>for the Lord will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his name in vain;</hi> that is, he will moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſh ſuch a one. And 'tis very obſervable, that there is no threatning added to any other Commandment, but to <hi>this</hi> and the <hi>ſecond;</hi> Intimating to us that, next to Idolatry and the worſhip of a falſe God, Perjury is one of the greateſt affronts that can be offered to the divine Majeſty. This is one of thoſe ſins that cries ſo loud to Heaven, and quickens the pace of God's judgments, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.9. <hi>I will come near to you in judgement, and be a ſwift witneſs againſt the ſwearer.</hi> For this God threatens utter deſtruction to the man and his houſe, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5.4. ſpeaking of the <hi>curſe that goeth over the face of the whole earth; God</hi> (ſays he) <hi>will bring it forth, and it ſhall enter into the houſe of him that ſweareth falſly by the name of God, and ſhall remain in the midſt of his houſe, and ſhall conſume it, with the timber thereof and the ſtones thereof. It ſhall remain in the midſt of his houſe, and ſhall conſume it.</hi> This ſin by the ſecret judgment of God undermines Eſtates and Families to the utter mine of them. And among the <hi>Heathen</hi> it was
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59936:77"/>always reckoned one of the greateſt of Crimes, and which they did believe God did not only puniſh upon the guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon himſelf, but upon his family and poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and many times upon whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the <hi>Prophet</hi> alſo tells us, that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Oaths the Land mourns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I need not uſe many words to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate this ſin; it is certainly a Crime of the higheſt nature. Deliberate Perjury being directly againſt a man's knowledge, ſo that no man can commit it without ſtaring his Conſcience in the face; which is one of the greateſt aggravations of any Crime. And it is equally a ſin againſt <hi>both Tables;</hi> being the higheſt affront to God, and of moſt injurious conſequence to men. It is an horrible abuſe of the name of God, an open contempt of his Judgment, and an inſolent defiance of his Vengeance: And in reſpect of men, it is not only a wrong to this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon who ſuffers by it, but Treaſon againſt humane Society; ſubverting at once the foundations of publick Peace and Juſtice, and the private ſecurity of every man's life and fortune. It is a defeating of the beſt and laſt way that the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of men could deviſe for the deciſion of doubtfull matters. <hi>Solomon</hi> very fully
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59936:77"/>and elegantly expreſſeth the deſtructive nature of this ſin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.18. <hi>A falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt his neighbour is a maul, and a ſword, and a ſharp arrow:</hi> Intimating, that amongſt all the inſtruments of ruine and miſchief that have been deviſed by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, none is of more pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to humane Society than Perjury, and breach of Faith. It is a <hi>peſtilence that</hi> uſually <hi>walketh in darkneſs,</hi> and a ſecret ſtab and blow againſt which many times there is no poſſibility of defence.</p>
               <p>And therefore it highly concerns thoſe who upon theſe and the like occaſions are called upon their Oath, whether as <hi>Jurors</hi> or <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> to ſet God before their eyes, and to have his fear in their hearts when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they come to take an oath. And to govern and diſcharge their conſciences in this matter by known and approved Rules, and by the Reſolutions of pious and wiſe men; and not by tht looſe Reaſonings and Reſolutions of <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> ſent abroad to ſerve the turns of unpeaceable and ill-minded men (whether <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> or <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or others) on purpoſe to debauch the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men by teaching them to play faſt and looſe with oaths. And it is a very ſad ſign of the decay of Chriſtian Religion amongſt us, to ſee ſo many who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59936:78"/>Chriſtians, to make ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſo great a ſin, as even the Light of Nature would bluſh and tremble at.</p>
               <p>I will conclude all with thoſe excellent <hi>Sayings</hi> of the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> concerning theſe two ſins (I have been ſpeaking of) of Prophane Swearing and Perjury, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 23.9, 10, &amp;c. <hi>Accuſtom not thy mouth to ſwearing; neither uſe thy ſelf to the naming of the holy One. A man that uſeth much ſwearing ſhall be filled with iniquity, and the plague ſhall never depart from his houſe. If he ſhall offend, his ſin ſhall he upon him; and if he acknowledg not his ſin, he maketh a double offence. And if he ſwear ſalſly, he ſhall not be innocent, but his houſe ſhall be full of calamities.</hi> And to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to us the dreadfull nature of this ſin of Perjury, <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a word that is cloathed about with death,</hi> meaning a raſh and falſe Oath; <hi>There is a word that is cloathed about with death, God grant it be not found in the heritage of Jacob: for all ſuch things ſhall be far from the godly; and they will not wallow in theſe ſins.</hi> From which God preſerve all good men, and make them carefull to preſerve themſelves; as they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the preſent peace of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and the favour of Almighty God in this world and the other, for his mercies ſake in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.

               <p>THE occaſion of theſe words of our bleſſed Saviour was an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which the <hi>Sadduces</hi> made againſt the Reſurrection, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59936:82"/>upon a caſe which had ſometimes happened among them, of a Woman that had had ſeven Brethren ſucceſſively to her Husbands. Upon which caſe they put this Queſtion to our Saviour; <hi>whoſe wife of the ſeven ſhall this woman be at the Reſurrection?</hi> That is, if men live in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world, how ſhall the controverſie between theſe ſeven Brethren be decided? for they all ſeem to have an equal claim to this Woman, each of them having had her to his wife.</p>
               <p>This captious Queſtion was not eaſie to be anſwered by the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who fancied the enjoyments of the next life to be of the ſame kind with the ſenſual pleaſures of this world, only greater and more durable. From which Tradition of the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning a ſenſual Paradiſe, <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſeems to have taken the pattern of his; as he did likewiſe many other things from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Traditions. Now upon this ſuppoſition, that in the next life there will be marrying and giving in marriage, it was a Queſtion not eaſily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, Whoſe wife of the ſeven this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould then be?</p>
               <p>But our Saviour clearly avoids the whole force of it, by ſhewing the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtate of men in this world, and in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59936:82"/>the other. <hi>The children of this world</hi> (ſays he) <hi>marry, and are given in marriage; but they who ſhall he accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the reſurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in marriage.</hi> And he does not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and magiſterially aſſert this Doctrine, but gives a plain and ſubſtantial Reaſon for it; becauſe <hi>they cannot die any more.</hi> After men have lived a while in this world they are taken away by death, and therefore marriage is neceſſary to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a ſucceſſion of mankind; but in the other world men ſhall become immortal and live for ever, and then the reaſon of marriage will wholly ceaſe: For when men can die no more there will then be no need of any new ſupplies of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour having thus cleared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of this Objection by taking away the ground and foundation of it, he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth an Argument for the proof of the Reſurrection, in the words of my Text; <hi>Now that the dead are raiſed, Moſes even ſhewed at the buſh, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob,</hi> That is, when in one of his Books God is brought in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to him out of the Buſh, and calling
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59936:83"/>himſelf by the title of the God of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi> From whence our Saviour infers the Reſurrection, becauſe <hi>God is not the God of the dead but of the living: For all live to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My deſign from theſe words is, to ſhew the force and ſtrength of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which our Saviour urgeth for the proof of the Reſurrection. In order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I ſhall,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider it as an Argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> and ſhew the fitneſs and force of it to convince thoſe with whom our Saviour diſputed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> I ſhall enquire, Whether it be more than an Argument <hi>ad hominem?</hi> And if it be, wherein the real and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute force of it doth conſiſt?</p>
               <p>And then, I ſhall apply this Doctrine of the Reſurrection to the preſent Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:59936:83"/>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What our Saviour intended direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and immediately to prove by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</item>
                  <item>2. The extraordinary veneration which the <hi>Jews</hi> in general had for the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> above any other Books of the Old Teſtament.</item>
                  <item>3. The peculiar notion which the <hi>Jews</hi> had concerning the uſe of this Phraſe or expreſſion of <hi>God's being any ones God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. The great reſpect which the <hi>Jews</hi> had for theſe three Fathers of their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacoh.</hi> For each of theſe make our Saviour's Argument more forcible againſt thoſe with whom he diſputed.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> We will conſider what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour intended directly and immediately to prove by this Argument. And that was this, That there is another ſtate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life, wherein men ſhall be happy or miſerable according as they have lived in this world. And this doth not only ſuppoſe the immortality of the Soul, but foraſmuch as the Body is an eſſential part of man doth by conſequence infer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Body; becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>man</hi> would not be happy or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſererable
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59936:84"/>in the other world. But I cannot ſee any ſufficient ground to believe that our Saviour intended by this Argument directly and immediately to prove the reſurrection of the Body, but only by conſequence, and as it follows from the admiſſion of a future ſtate wherein men ſhall be rewarded or puniſhed. For that Reaſon of our Saviour, that <hi>God is not a God of the dead but of the living,</hi> if it did directly prove the reſurrection of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it would prove that the Bodies of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were raiſed to life again, at or before that time when God ſpake to <hi>Moſes</hi> and called himſelf the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob:</hi> But we do not believe this; and therefore ought not to ſuppoſe that it was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of our Saviour directly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to prove the reſurrection of the Body, but only (as I ſaid before) a future ſtate. And that this was all our Saviour intended will more plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we conſider what that Errour of the <hi>Sadduces</hi> was which our Saviour here confutes. And <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who very well underſtood the difference of the Sects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> and gives a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them, makes not the leaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Controverſie between the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59936:84"/>
                  <hi>Phariſees</hi> and the <hi>Sadduces</hi> about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Body. All that he ſays, is this: That the <hi>Phariſees</hi> hold the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul, and that there are Rewards and Puniſhments in another world: But the <hi>Sadduces</hi> denied all this, and that there was any other ſtate after this life. And this is the very ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with that which is given of them in the <hi>New Teſtament, verſ.</hi> 27. of this <hi>Chapt. The Sadduces who deny that there is any reſurrection.</hi> The meaning of which is more fully declared, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.8. <hi>The Sadduces ſay that there is no reſurrection, neither angel nor ſpirit; but the Phariſees confeſs both.</hi> That is, the <hi>Sadduces</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that there was any other ſtate of men after this life, and that there was any ſuch thing as an immortal Spirit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angels, or the Souls of men ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Bodies. And, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath judiciouſly obſerved, this is the true importance of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>future or another ſtate;</hi> unleſs in ſuch Texts where the Context does reſtrain it to the raiſing again of the Body, or where ſome word that denotes the <hi>body,</hi> as <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is added to it.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:59936:85"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> The force of this Argument againſt thoſe with whom our Saviour diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted will further appear, if we conſider the great veneration which the <hi>Jews</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral had for the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> above any other Books of the Old Teſtament; which they (eſpecially the <hi>Sadduces</hi>) looked upon only as Explications and Comments upon the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> But they eſteemed nothing as a neceſſary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith which had not ſome foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the Writings of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And this ſeems to me to be the true Reaſon why our Saviour choſe to confute them out of <hi>Moſes,</hi> rather than any other part of the Old Teſtament: And not as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned men have imagined, becauſe the <hi>Sadduces</hi> did not receive any part of the Old Teſtament but only the <hi>five</hi> Books of <hi>M ſes;</hi> ſo that it was in vain to argue againſt them out of any other. This I know hath been a general opinion, grounded I think upon the miſtake of a paſſage in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who ſays the <hi>Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces only received the written Law.</hi> But if We carefully conſider that paſſage, we ſhall find that <hi>Joſephus</hi> doth not there oppoſe the Law to the <hi>other B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ks</hi> of the Old Teſtament, which were alſo <hi>written;</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:59936:85"/>but to <hi>Oral Tradition.</hi> For he ſays ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that <hi>the Sadduces only received the written Law, but the Phariſees, over and beſides what was written, received the Oral which they call Tradition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I deny not but that in the <hi>later</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets there are more expreſs <hi>Texts</hi> for the proof of a future ſtate, than any are to be found in the Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> As <hi>Daniel</hi> 12.2. <hi>And many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake, ſ me to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting contempt.</hi> And indeed it ſeems very plain that holy men among the <hi>Jews,</hi> towards the expiration of the Legal diſpenſation, had ſtill clearer and more expreſs apprehenſions concerning a future ſtate than are to be met with in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or of any of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſuppoſe the <hi>Immortality of the Souls of men,</hi> and the <hi>expectation of another life after this,</hi> as Principles of Religion in ſome degree naturally known; but made no new and expreſs Revelation of theſe things. Nor was there any occaſion for it, the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> being a Political Law, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Government of mankind, but of one particular Nation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59936:86"/>was eſtabliſh'd, as Political Laws
are, upon temporal promiſes and threatnings; promiſing temporal proſperity to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of its precepts, and threatning the breach of them with temporal judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and calamities.</p>
               <p>And this I take to be the true reaſon why arguments fetch'd from another world are ſo obſcurely inſiſted upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Diſpenſation; not but that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life after this was always ſuppos'd, and was undoubtedly the hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of good men under the Law, but the clear diſcovery of it was reſerv'd for the Times of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as thoſe Times drew on, and <hi>the Son of righteouſneſs</hi> was nearer his riſing, the ſhadows of the night began to be chaſed away, and mens apprehenſions of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate to clear up; ſo that in the time of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> good men ſpake with more confidence and aſſurance of theſe things.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe to be conſider'd, that the temporal calamities and ſufferings with which the <hi>Jews</hi> were almoſt continually haraſs'd from the time of their Captivity had very much wean'd good men from the conſideration of temporal promiſes, and awaken'd their minds to the more
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59936:86"/>ſerious thoughts of another world. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing natural to men when they are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of preſent comfort, to ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the expectation of better things for the future, and as the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>ch.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>To fly for refuge to lay hold upon the hope that is before them,</hi> and to employ their reaſon to fortifie themſelves as well as they can in that perſuaſion.</p>
               <p>And this I doubt not was the true oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of thoſe clearer and riper apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of good men concerning a future ſtate, in thoſe times of diſtreſs and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; it being very agreeable to the wiſdom and goodneſs of the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence not to leave his People deſtitute of ſufficient ſupport under great trials and ſufferings: And nothing but the hopes of a better life could have born up the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men under ſuch cruel tortures. And of this we have a moſt remarkable Inſtance in the Hiſtory of the <hi>ſeven Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> in the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> who being cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tortured and put to death by <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> do moſt expreſly declare their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident expectation of a reſurrection to a better life. To which Hiſtory the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> certainly refers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. when he ſays, <hi>others were tortured, not accepting
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59936:87"/>deliverance, that they might obtain a better reſurrection:</hi> where the word, which we render <hi>were tortur'd,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is the very word uſed in the <hi>Maccabees</hi> to expreſs the particular kind of torture us'd upon them; beſides that being <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd deliverance</hi> they moſt reſolutely <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd</hi> to <hi>accept</hi> of it, with this expreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration that they hop'd for a <hi>reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to a <hi>better</hi> life.</p>
               <p>But to return to my purpoſe, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there might be more clear and expreſs <hi>Texts</hi> to this purpoſe in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Prophets,</hi> yet our Saviour knowing how great a regard not only the <hi>Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> but all the <hi>Jews</hi> had to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he thought fit to bring his proof of the reſurrection out of his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as that which was the moſt likely to convince them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> If we conſider further the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Notion which the <hi>Jews</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the uſe of this phraſe or expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>God's being any ones God.</hi> And that was this. That God is no where in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaid to be any ones God while he was alive. And therefore they tell us that while <hi>Iſaac</hi> lived, God is not called the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but the <hi>ſear of Iſaac.</hi> As
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59936:87"/>
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.42. <hi>Except the God of Abraham, and the fear of Iſaac had been with me;</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 53. when <hi>Laban</hi> made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with <hi>Jacob,</hi> 'tis ſaid that <hi>Laban did ſwear by the God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, and the God of their Fathers,</hi> but <hi>Jacob</hi> ſwore <hi>by the fear of his Father Iſaac.</hi> I will not warrant this Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be good, becauſe I certainly know it is not true. For God doth expreſly call himſelf the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> while <hi>Iſaac</hi> was yet alive, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.13. <hi>I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Iſaac.</hi> It is ſufficient to my purpoſe, that this was a Notion anciently currant among the <hi>Jews.</hi> And therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Argument from this Expreſſion muſt be ſo much the ſtronger againſt <hi>them:</hi> For if the Souls of men be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by death (as the <hi>Sadduces</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) what did it ſignifie to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> to have God called <hi>their God</hi> after they were dead? But ſurely for God to be any ones God doth ſignifie ſome great benefit and advantage; which yet (according to the notion which the <hi>Jews</hi> had of this Phraſe) could not reſpect this life, becauſe, according to <hi>them,</hi> God is not ſaid to be any ones God till after he is dead: But it is thus ſaid of <hi>Abraham,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59936:88"/>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> after their death, and therefore our Saviour infers very ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt <hi>them,</hi> that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were not extinguiſhed by death, but do ſtill live ſomewhere: for <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</hi> And then he adds by way of further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, <hi>for all live to him.</hi> That is, though thoſe good men who are departed this life, do not ſtill live <hi>to us,</hi> here in this world, yet <hi>they live to God,</hi> and are with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly.</hi> If we conſider the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which the <hi>Jews</hi> had for thoſe three Fathers of their Nation, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> They had an extraordinary opinion of them, and eſteemed nothing too great to be thought or ſaid of them. And therefore we find that they looked upon it as a great arrogance for any man to aſſume any thing to himſelf that might ſeem to ſet him above <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> or <hi>Jacob.</hi> With what indignation did they fly upon our Saviour on this account? <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Art thou greater than our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jacob?</hi> and <hi>chap.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 53. <hi>Art thou greater than our father Abraham: whom makeſt thou thy ſelf?</hi> Now they who had ſo ſuperſtitious a veneration for
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59936:88"/>them, would eaſily believe any thing of privilege to belong to them: ſo that our Saviour doth with great advantage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in them, in favour of whom they would be inclined to extend the meaning of any promiſe to the utmoſt, and allow it to ſignifie as much as the words could poſſibly bear. So that it is no wonder that the <hi>Text</hi> tells us that this Argument put the <hi>Sadduces</hi> to ſilence. They durſt not attempt a thing ſo odious, as to go about to take away any thing of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege from <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I have, as briefly as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would bear, endeavoured to ſhew the fitneſs and force of this Argument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thoſe with whom our Saviour diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted. I come now, in the</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. <hi>Second</hi> place, to enquire Whether this be any more than an Argument <hi>ad hominem?</hi> And if it be, wherein the real and abſolute force of it doth conſiſt?</p>
               <p>I do not think it neceſſary to believe that every Argument uſed by our Saviour or his Apoſtles, is abſolutely and in it ſelf concluſive of the matter in debate. For an Argument which doth not really prove the thing in Queſtion, may yet be a very good Argument <hi>ad hominem;</hi> and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59936:89"/>in ſome caſes more convincing to him with whom we diſpute than that which is a better Argument in it ſelf. Now it is poſſible, that our Saviour's intention might not be to bring a concluſive proof of the Reſurrection, but only to confute thoſe who would needs be diſputing with him. And to that purpoſe an Argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> which proceeded upon grounds which they themſelves could not deny, might be very proper and effectual. But although it be not neceſſary to believe, that this was more than an Argument <hi>ad hominem;</hi> yet it is the better to us, if it be abſolutely and in it ſelf concluſive of the thing in Queſtion. And this I hope will ſufficiently appear, if we conſider theſe <hi>four</hi> things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That for God to be <hi>any ones God</hi> doth ſignifie ſome very extraordinary bleſſing and happineſs, to thoſe perſons of whom this is ſaid.</item>
                  <item>2. If we conſider the eminent faith and obedience of the perſons to whom this promiſe is made.</item>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> If we conſider, that for God to be <hi>any ones God</hi> doth ſignifie ſome very extraordinary bleſſing and happineſs to thoſe perſons of whom this is ſaid. It is a big word for God to declare himſelf to be <hi>any ones God:</hi> and the leaſt we can imagine to be meant by it, is that God will in an extraordinary manner employ his power and wiſdom to do him good: that he will concern himſelf more for the happineſs of thoſe whoſe God he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf to be, than for others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we conſider the eminent faith and obedience of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob. Abraham</hi> left his Country in obedience to God, not knowing whither he was to go. And, which was one of the moſt unparallel'd and ſtrange inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of faith and obedience that can almoſt be imagined, he was willing to have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed his only Son at the command of God. <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were alſo very good men, and devout worſhippers of the true God, when almoſt the whole world was ſunk into Idolatry and all manner of impiety. Now what can we imagin, but that the good God did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign ſome extraordinary reward to ſuch
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59936:90"/>faithful ſervants of his? eſpecially if we conſider, that he intended this gracious declaration of his concerning them, for a ſtanding encouragement to all thoſe who in after Ages ſhould follow the faith and tread in the ſteps of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> If we conſider the condition of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in this world. The Scripture tells us, that <hi>they were pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims and ſtrangers upon the earth;</hi> had no fixed and ſettled habitation, but were forced to wander from one Kingdom and Countrey to another: that they were expoſed to many hazards and difficulties, to great troubles and afflictions in this world; ſo that there was no ſuch pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar happineſs befell them in this life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the common rate of men, as may ſeem to fill up the big words of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that <hi>God would be their God.</hi> For ſo far as the Scripture Hiſtory informs us, and further we cannot know of this matter, <hi>Eſau</hi> was as proſperous as <hi>Jacob;</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> had a great many more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and afflictions in this life than <hi>Eſau</hi> had. But ſuerly when God calls himſelf <hi>the God of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob,</hi> this ſignifies that God intended ſome very
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59936:90"/>peculiar bleſſing and advantage to them above others: which ſeeing they did not enjoy in this world, it is very reaſonable to believe that one time or other this gracious declaration and promiſe or God was made good to them.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Apoſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, chap.</hi> 11. from this very expreſſion of <hi>God's</hi> being ſaid <hi>to be the God</hi> of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and others, argues that ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary happineſs was reſerved for them in another world: and that upon this very ground I am now ſpeaking of, namely, becauſe the condition of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and ſome others, was not ſuch in this world as might ſeem to anſwer the fulneſs of this promiſe. <hi>All theſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>died in the faith, not having received the promiſes, but having ſeen them a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ar off, and were perſwaded of them, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced them, and confeſſed that they were ſtrangers and pilgrims upon the earth.</hi> From whence he reaſons very ſtrongly that theſe good men might reaſonably expect ſomething better than any thing that had befallen them in this World. <hi>For they,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that ſay ſuch things, declare plainly that they ſeek a Country;</hi> which at the 16. <hi>verſe</hi> he calls <hi>a better Country, that is a heavenly. They that ſay
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59936:91"/>ſuch things:</hi> that is, they who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themſelves to be ſtrangers and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims in the earth, and yet pretend that God hath promiſed <hi>to be their God,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare plainly that they expect ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward beyond this life. From all which he concludes, <hi>Wherefore God is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be called their God, becauſe he hath prepared for them a City:</hi> Intimating that if no happineſs had remained for theſe good men in another world, this promiſe of God's <hi>being their God,</hi> would ſhamefully have fallen ſhort of what it ſeemed to import, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reward and bleſſing worthy of God to beſtow; ſomething more certain and laſting than any of the enjoyments of this world: which ſince God hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly performed to them in the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of another life, his promiſe to them was made good to the full, and he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not <hi>be aſhamed to be called their God.</hi> But if nothing beyond this life had been reſerved for them, that Saying of old <hi>Jacob</hi> towards the concluſion of his life, <hi>few and evil have the days of the years of my life been,</hi> would have been an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reflection upon the truth and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of him who had ſo often called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:59936:91"/>
               <p>But now, becauſe to all this it may be ſaid, that this Promiſe ſeems to have been made good to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in this world: For was not God the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he took ſuch a particular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traoadinary care of them, and protected them from the manifold dangers they were expoſed to, by ſuch a ſpecial and immediate providence, <hi>ſuffering no one to do them harm, but rebuking even Kings for their ſakes?</hi> Was not he <hi>Abraham</hi>'s God, when he bleſt him ſo miraculouſly with a Son in his old age, and with ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable an eſtate to leave to him? Was not that Saying of <hi>Jacob</hi> a great acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the gracious providence of God towards him, <hi>with my ſtaff paſſed I over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands?</hi> And though it muſt needs be a very cutting affliction to him to loſe his Son <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as he thought he had done, yet that was more than recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed to him in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s ſtrange advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Egypt,</hi> whereby God put into his hands the opportunity of ſaving his Father and his whole Family alive. And was not God <hi>the God</hi> of <hi>Abraham Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in making them Fathers of ſo numerons an off-ſpring, as afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59936:92"/>came <hi>a great nation:</hi> and in giving them a fruitful Land; and bringing them to the quiet poſſeſſion of it by ſuch a <hi>ſeries</hi> of wonderful Miracles? what need then is there of extending this promiſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother world? doth it not ſeem abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly made good in thoſe great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which God beſtowed upon them whilſt they liv'd, and afterwards upon their poſterity, in this world? And does not this agree well enough with the firſt and moſt obvious ſenſe of theſe words, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob,</hi> that is, I am he that was their God while they were alive, and am ſtill the God of their poſterity for their ſakes? I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>three</hi> former Conſiderations are liable to this Objection, which ſeems wholly to take off the force of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; therefore for the full clearing of this matter, I will add one conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> then, we will conſider the general importance of this Promiſe, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting from the particular perſons ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified and named in it, <hi>viz. Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> and that is, that God will make a wide and plain difference between good and bad men; he will be
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59936:92"/>
                  <hi>ſo</hi> the God of good men as he is not of the wicked: and ſome time or other put every good man into a better and happier condition than any wicked man: ſo that the general importance of this promiſe is finally reſolved into the equity and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Divine Providence.</p>
               <p>And unleſs we ſuppoſe another life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, it will certainly be very hard, and I think impoſſible, to reconcile the Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament, and the common appearances of things in this World, with the Juſtice and Goodneſs of God's Providence.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied, but that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ſeveral good men in the old Teſtament, had many ſignal Teſtimonies of the Divine favour vouchſafed to them in this world: But we read likewiſe of ſeveral wicked men that had as large a ſhare of temporal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. It is very true that <hi>Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> had great eſtates, and were petty Princes: But <hi>Pharoah</hi> was a mighty Prince in compariſon of them; and the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably was the firſt and chief ſeat of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, was at the ſame time one of the moſt potent and flouriſhing Kingdoms in the world: and was bleſt with a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59936:93"/>plenty, whereby they were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſtore of corn, when good <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Family had like to have periſhed by famine. 'Tis true, <hi>Joſeph,</hi> was ad anc'd to great power in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and thereby had the opportunity of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Fathers houſe, by ſetling them, and feeding them in <hi>Egypt:</hi> But then it is to be conſidered again, that this coſt them very dear, and their coming thither was the occaſion of a long and cruel bondage to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s poſterity, ſo that we ſee that theſe good men had no ſuch bleſſings, but what were common with them to many others that were wicked: and the bleſſings which God beſtowed upon, them had great abatements by the intermixture of many and ſore afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>It ſeems then upon the whole matter, to be very plain, that the Providences of God in this world towards good men are ſo contrived, that it may ſufficiently appear, to thoſe who wiſely conſider the works of God, that they are not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by him; and yet that theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſings are ſo promiſcuouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed, that no man can certainly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be a good man from any hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs he enjoys in this life: And the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59936:93"/>proſperity of good men is uſually on purpoſe ſo ſhadowed and mixed with afflictions, as may juſtly raiſe their hopes to the expectation of a more perfect hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and better reward than any they meet with in this world.</p>
               <p>And if ſo, then the general importance of this Promiſe, that <hi>God will be the God</hi> of good men, muſt neceſſarily ſignifie ſomething beyond this world: Becauſe in this world there is not that clear diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence univerſally made betwen good and bad men which the Juſtice of the Divine Providence doth require, and which ſeems to be intended in the general ſence of this Promiſe. For if this Promiſe (though perſonally made to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>) be intended, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture tells us it was for a ſtanding encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to good men in all Ages, then it muſt contain in it this general Truth, <hi>that God will ſome time or other plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reward every good man;</hi> that is, he will do ſomething far better for him than for any wicked man: But if there be no life after this, it is impoſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile this ſenſe of it with the courſe of God's Providence, and with the Hiſtory of the Bible.</p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:59936:94"/>
               <p>And to make this out fully and at once, I will only produce that ſingle In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain. Abel</hi> offered to God <hi>a more excellent ſacrifice than Cain,</hi> and he <hi>had this teſtimony, that he pleaſed God;</hi> which was in effect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that <hi>God was the God of Abel</hi> and not of <hi>Cain;</hi> ſo that by virtue of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral importance of this Promiſe, it might juſtly be expected that <hi>Abel</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſhould have been much better than <hi>Cain</hi>'s: But if there be no happineſs after this life, <hi>Abel</hi>'s was evidently much worſe. For upon this very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that <hi>he pleaſed God better,</hi> he was killed by <hi>Cain,</hi> who had offered to God a ſlight and contemptuous offering. And <hi>Cain</hi> lived a long time after, and grew great, and <hi>built Cities.</hi> Now ſuppoſing there were no other life after this, this muſt have been a moſt horrible Example to all Ages, from the beginning of the world to the end of it, and have made men for ever afraid to pleaſe God upon ſuch hard terms; when they were ſure of no other reward for ſo doing, but to be oppreſs'd and ſlain by the hands of the wicked. So that if this were really the Caſe, it would puzzle all the Wit and Reaſon of mankind to vindicate the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59936:94"/>and juſtice of the Divine Providence, and to reſcue it out of the hands of this terrible Objection.</p>
               <p>And thus have I as briefly as I could, endeavoured to clear to you the force of this Argument uſed by our Saviour for the Proof of the Reſurrection. And have the longer inſiſted upon it, becauſe at firſt appearance it ſeems to be but a very obſcure and remote Argument: And yet ſo much the more neceſſary to be clear'd, becauſe this in all probability was that very <hi>Text</hi> upon which the <hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviours time grounded their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a future ſtate, in oppoſition to the error of the <hi>Sadduces;</hi> and which they call'd by way of eminency <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made of God unto the Fathers.</hi> As will plainly appear, if we conſider what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays to this purpoſe; when he appeals ſo often to the <hi>Phariſees</hi> for his agreement with them in this Article of the Reſurrection, and likewiſe in the ground of it from <hi>the promiſe made of God unto the fathers.</hi> Act. 24.14, 15 <hi>But this I confeſs unto thee, that after the way which they call hereſie, ſo worſhip I the God of my Fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59936:95"/>and have hope towards God, which they themſelves alſo allow, that there ſhall be a reſurrection of the dead.</hi> From whence it is clear, that they both ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their hope of the reſurrection upon ſomething <hi>written in the Law and the Prophets;</hi> and what that was he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth more particularly <hi>c.</hi> 26. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7 <hi>And now I ſtand, and am judged for the hope of the promiſe made of God unto our Fathers; unto which promiſe our twelve Tribes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſerving God day and night, hope to come. By the promiſe made of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fathers</hi> he means ſome promiſe made by God to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob;</hi> for ſo S. <hi>Luke</hi> more than once, in his Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> explains this phraſe <hi>of the God of their Fathers,</hi> Acts 3.13. <hi>The God of Abraham, and of Iſaac, and of Jacob, the God of our Fathers;</hi> and <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>I am the God thy Fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob.</hi> Now what was the great and famous Promiſe which God made to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob?</hi> was it not this of being <hi>their God?</hi> So that it was this very Promiſe upon which S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us the <hi>Jews</hi> grounded their hope of a future ſtate, becauſe they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it neceſſarily to ſignifie ſome
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59936:95"/>bleſſing and happineſs beyond this life.</p>
               <p>And now having, I hope, ſufficiently clear'd this matter, I ſhall make ſome improvement of this Doctrine of a future ſtate, and that to theſe three purpoſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To raiſe our minds above this world and the enjoyments of this preſent life. Were but men thorougly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of this plain and certain Truth, that there is a vaſt difference between Time and Eternity, between a few years and everlaſting Ages: would we but repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our ſelves what thoughts and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions dying perſons have of this world; how vain and empty a thing it appears to them, how like a pageant and a ſhadow it looks as it paſſeth away from them: methinks none of thoſe things could be a ſufficient temptation to any man to forget God and his Soul; but, notwithſtanding all the delights and pleaſures of ſenſe, we ſhould be ſtrangely intent upon the concernments of another world, and almoſt wholly taken up with the thoughts of that vaſt Eternity which we are ready to launch into. For what is there in this world, this <hi>waſte and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wilderneſs,</hi> this rude and barbarous Country which we are but to paſs
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59936:96"/>through, which ſhould detain our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections here, and take off our thoughts from our everlaſting habitation; from that better and that <hi>heavenly Country,</hi> where we hope to live and be happy for ever?</p>
               <p>If we ſettle our affections upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of this preſent Life, ſo as to be extremely pleas'd and tranſported with them, and to ſay in our hearts, <hi>It is good for us to be here;</hi> if we be exceſſively griev'd or diſcontented for the want or loſs of them, and if we look upon our preſent ſtate in this world any otherwiſe than as a preparation and paſſage to a better life, it is a ſign that our faith and hope of the happineſs of another life is but very weak and faint, and that we do not heartily and in good earneſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what we pretend to do concerning theſe things. For did we ſtedfaſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and were thoroughly perſwaded of what our Religion ſo plainly declares to us concerning the unſpeakable and endleſs happineſs of good men in another world, our affections would ſit more looſe to this world, and our hopes would raiſe our hearts as much above theſe preſent and ſenſible things <hi>as the heavens are high above the earth;</hi> we ſhould value no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59936:96"/>here below, but as it ſerves for our preſent ſupport and paſſage, or may be made a means to ſecure and increaſe our future felicity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The conſideration of another Life ſhould quicken our preparation for that bleſſed ſtate which remains for us in the other world. This Life is a ſtate of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and trial. This world is God's ſchool, where immortal ſpirits clothed with fleſh are trained and bred up for eternity. And then certainly it is not an indifferent thing and a matter of ſlight concernment to us, how we live and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean our ſelves in this world: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we indulge our ſelves <hi>in ungodlineſs and worldly luſts,</hi> or <hi>live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly</hi> in this preſent world: No; it is a matter of infinite mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as much as our ſouls and all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity are worth. Let us not deceive our ſelves; <hi>for as we ſow ſo ſhall we reap: If we ſow to the fleſh, we ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption; but if we ſow to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, we ſhall of the ſpirit reap everlaſting life. Light is ſown for the righteous, and gladneſs for the upright in heart. The righteous hath hopes in his death. Mark the perfect man, and behold the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59936:97"/>upright, for the end of that man is peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the ungodly are not ſo: whoever hath lived a wicked and vicious life, feels ſtrange throws and pangs in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence when he comes to be caſt: upon a ſick bed. <hi>The wicked is like the troubled ſea</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Prophet</hi>) <hi>when it cannot reſt;</hi> full of trouble and confuſion, eſpecially in a dying hour. It is death to ſuch a man to look back upon his life, and a hell to him to think of eternity. When his guilty and trembling Soul is ready to leave his Body, and juſt ſtepping into the other world, what horrour and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do then ſeiſe upon him? what a rage does ſuch a man feel in his breaſt, when he ſeriouſly conſiders, that he hath been ſo great a fool as for the falſe and imperfect pleaſure of a few days to make himſelf miſerable for ever?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let the conſideration of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Reward which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to good men at the Reſurrection, encourage us to obedience and a holy life. We ſerve a great Prince who is able to promote us to honour; a moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Maſter who will not let the leaſt ſervice we do for him paſs unrewarded. This is the Inference which the Apoſtle
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59936:97"/>makes from this large diſcourſe of the Doctrine of the Reſurrrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. <hi>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye ſtedfaſt and unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as ye know that your labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi> Nothing will make death more welcome to us than a conſtant courſe of ſervice and obedience to God. <hi>Sleep,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, is ſweet to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring man:</hi> ſo after a great diligence and induſtry in <hi>working out our own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and (as it is ſaid of <hi>David</hi>) <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our generation according to the will of God,</hi> how pleaſant will it be to fall aſleep? And as an uſeful and well-ſpent life will make our death to be ſweet, ſo our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to be glorious. Whatever acts of Piety we do to God, or of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to men; whatever we lay out upon the poor and afflicted and neceſſitous, will all be conſidered by God in the day of recompences, and moſt plentifully rewarded to us.</p>
               <p>And ſurely no conſideration ought to be more prevalent to perſwade us to alms-deeds and charity to the poor, than that of a reſurrection to another life. Beſides the promiſes of this life which are made to works of charity, and there is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59936:98"/>not any grace or vertue whaſoever, which hath ſo many and ſo great promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of temporal bleſſings made to it in Scripture as this grace of charity; I ſay, beſides the promiſes of this Life, the great promiſe of eternal Life is in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in a more eſpecial manner entail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.33. <hi>Give alms,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>provide your ſelves baggs which wax not old, a treaſure in the heavens that faileth not;</hi> and <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>make to your ſelves friends of the mammon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, that when ye ſhall fail they may receive you into everlaſting habitations.</hi> And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17, 18, 19. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, willing to communicate, laying up in ſtore for themſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life; the word</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which our Tranſlation renders <hi>foundation</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common uſe of it, ſeems in this place to have a more peculiar notion, and to ſignifie the <hi>ſecurity</hi> that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by a <hi>pledge,</hi> or by an <hi>inſtrument</hi> or obligation of <hi>contract</hi> for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of <hi>Covenants.</hi> For beſides that the phraſe of <hi>laying up in ſtore, or treaſurng
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59936:98"/>up a foundation,</hi> ſeems to be a very odd jumbling of metaphors; this very word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> almoſt neceſſarily requires this notion as it is uſed by the ſame <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> in his ſecond <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> chap. 2. ver. 19. where it is ſaid, <hi>the foundation of God ſtands ſure, having this ſeal,</hi> &amp;c. a <hi>ſeal</hi> being very improper <hi>to ſtrengthen a foundation,</hi> but very fit <hi>to confirm a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> And then ſurely it ought to be render'd, <hi>the Covenant of God remains firm, having this ſeal.</hi> And ſo likewiſe in the foremention'd Text, the ſenſe will be much more eaſie and current if we render it thus, <hi>treaſuring up, or providing for themſelves a good ſecurity</hi> or <hi>pledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the time to come;</hi> I add <hi>pledge,</hi> becauſe that anciently was the common way of ſecurity for things lent: beſides that the Apoſtle ſeems plainly to allude to that paſſage, <hi>Tobit,</hi> 4 8, 9. <hi>If thou haſt abundance, give alms accordingly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for thou layeſt up a good treaſure for thy ſelf againſt the day of neceſſity,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>for thou treaſureſt up for thy ſelf a good pledge;</hi> to which this of the Apoſtle exactly anſwers, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>treaſuring up, or providing for themſelves a good pledge or ſecurity,</hi> &amp;c. the ſenſe however
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59936:99"/>is plain, that the charity of Alms is one of the beſt ways of ſecuring our future happineſs.</p>
               <p>And yet further to encourage us to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in works of charity, the Scripture tells us that proportionably to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of our charity ſhall be the degrees of our reward; upon this conſideration the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> exhorts the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to be liberal in their charity, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9 6. <hi>he that ſoweth ſparingly ſhall reap ſparingly, but he that ſoweth bountifully ſhall reap bountifully.</hi> So that whatever we lay out in this kind is to the <hi>greateſt advantage,</hi> and upon the <hi>beſt ſecurity;</hi> two conſiderations which uſe to be very prevalent with rich men to lay out their money.</p>
               <p>We certainiy do it to the <hi>greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;</hi> becauſe God will conſider the very ſmalleſt thing that any of us do in this kind. He that ſhall <hi>give</hi> ſo much as <hi>a cup of cold water to a diſciple, in the name of a diſciple, ſhall not loſe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> theſe laſt words, <hi>ſhall not loſe his reward,</hi> are a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſignifie much more than they ſeem to ſpeak, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſhall have a very great reward, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely beyond the value of what he hath done.</p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:59936:99"/>
               <p>And we do it likewiſe upon the <hi>beſt ſecurity;</hi> ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> aſſures us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.17. <hi>He that hath pity upon the poor len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the Lord, and that which he hath given will he pay him again:</hi> and we may be confident of our ſecurity where God is ſurety; nay, he tells us that in this caſe he looks upon himſelf as principal, and that whatever we do in ways of mercy and charity to the poor he takes as done to himſelf. So our Lord hath told us, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.40. and we ſhall hear the ſame from him again out of his own mouth when he ſhall appear in his Majeſty to judge the World, <hi>Then the King ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and ſay unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, inaſmuch as ye havn done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And on the other ſide, the Scripture no where paſſeth a more ſevere doom upon any ſort of perſons, than upon thoſe who have no bowels of compaſſion towards their brethren in diſtreſs. That is a fearful ſentence indeed, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle pronounceth upon ſuch perſons, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.13. <hi>He ſhall have judgment without mercy that hath ſhewed no mercy.</hi> And this our Saviour repreſents to us in a moſt ſolemn manner, in that lively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59936:100"/>which he makes of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great day, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.31, &amp;c. <hi>When the Son of man ſhall come in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and all the holy Angels with him, then ſhall he ſit upon the throne of his glory: and before him ſhall be gathered all nations, and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a ſhepherd divideth the ſheep from the goats. And he ſhall ſet the ſheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then ſhall the King ſay unto them on the right hand, Come ye bleſſed of my Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom prepared for you, before the foundation of the world. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink; I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me; I was ſick, and ye viſited me; I was in priſon, and ye came unto me. Then ſhall He ſay, alſo unto them on the left hand, Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels: For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment; but the righteous into life eternal.</hi> And if this be, as moſt certainly it is, a true and proper repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the proceſs of that Day, then the great matter of enquiry will be, What works of charity and mercy have
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59936:100"/>been done or neglected by us, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly a Sentence of eternal happineſs, or miſery, will be paſs'd upon us: I was hungry, did ye feed me or did ye not? I was naked, did ye clothe me or did ye not? I was ſick and in priſon, did ye viſit me or did ye not? Not but that all the good or evil of our lives, in what kind ſoever, ſhall then be brought to account; But that our Saviour did chuſe to inſtance particularly, and only in things of this nature, ſhould methinks make a mighty impreſſion upon us, and be a powerful conſideration to oblige us to have a very peculiar regard to works of mercy and charity, and to make ſure <hi>to abound in this Grace;</hi> that when we ſhall appear before the great Judge of the world we may find that mercy from Him which we have ſhew'd to others, and which we ſhall all undoubtedly ſtand in need of <hi>in that Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And among all our acts of charity, thoſe which are done upon leaſt probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and foreſight of their meeting with any recompence in this world, either by way of real requital or of fame and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as they are of all other moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, ſo they will certainly have the moſt ample reward in another world. So our Lord hath aſſur'd us, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59936:101"/>accordingly adviſeth us, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.12, 13, 14. <hi>When thou makeſt a feaſt, invite not the rich, becauſe they will recompenſe thee again: but call the poor, the maimed, the lame and the blind, for they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe thee, but thou ſhalt he recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the reſurrection of the juſt.</hi> If we be Religious for worldly ends, and ſerve God, and do good to men, onely in contemplation of ſome temporal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, we take up with preſent payment, and cut our ſelves ſhort of our future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: of ſuch, ſaith our Lord, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, they have their reward;</hi> they are their own ſecurity, and have taken care to ſatisfy themſelves, and therefore are to expect, nothing from God. But let us who call our ſelves Chriſtians do ſomething for God, for which we have no hopes to be recompenſed in this world; that we may ſhew that we truſt God and take his word, and dare ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the ſecurity of the next world, and that <hi>recompenſe</hi> which ſhall be made <hi>at the reſurrection of the just.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And how great and glorious that ſhall be, our Saviour tells us immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my <hi>Text. They that ſhall be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy to obtain that world, and the reſurrection from the dead, they can die no
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59936:101"/>more, but they are equal to the Angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then we be heirs of ſuch glorious hopes, and believe that he who is <hi>the God of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob,</hi> will alſo be our God; let us live as it becomes the Candidates of heaven, and <hi>the children of the reſurrection,</hi> and ſuch as verily believe another life after this, and hope one day to <hi>ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, in the Kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now that I have repreſented to you what encouragement there is to well-doing, and particularly to works of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, from the conſideration of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reward we ſhall certainly meet with at the Reſurrection of the juft; I ſhall crave your patience a little longer, whilſt I propoſe to you one of the faireſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this kind which either this or perhaps any other Age could eaſily preſent us withall: I mean our deceaſed Brother to whom we are now paying our laſt ſolemn reſpects, the Reverend Mr. <hi>THOMAS GO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GE;</hi> the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Son of a reverend and learned Divine of this City, Dr. <hi>Williaw Gouge,</hi> who was Miniſter of this Pariſh of <hi>Black Friars</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:59936:102"/>ſix and forty years; he died in 1653. and ſtill lives in the memory of many here preſent.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, that I am no friend to Funeral <hi>Panegyricks,</hi> where there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of extraordinary worth and merit in the party commended to give occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and foundation for them: In ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as praiſes are not due to the dead, ſo they may be of ill conſequence to the living: not only by bringing thoſe of our Profeſſion that make a practice of it, under the ſuſpicion of officious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary flattery, but likewiſe by encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging men to hope that they alſo may be well ſpoken of, and even Sainted when they are dead, though they ſhould have done little or no good in their life: But yet on the other hand, to commend thoſe excellent Perſons the vertues of whoſe lives have been bright and exemplary, is not only a piece of juſtice due to the dead, but an act of great charity to the living, ſetting a pattern of well-doing before our eyes, very apt and powerful to incite and encourage us <hi>to go and do likewiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon both theſe Conſiderations, firſt to do right to the memory of ſo good a man, and then in hopes that the example
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59936:102"/>may prove fruitful and have a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effect upon others to beget the like goodneſs and charity in them, I ſhall endeavour, in as narrow a compaſs as may be, to give you the juſt character of this truly pious and charitable Man, and by ſetting his life in a true light to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend with all the advantage I can ſo excellent a pattern to your imitation.</p>
               <p>He was born at <hi>Bow</hi> near <hi>Stratford</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex</hi> the 19th. day of September 1605. He was bred at <hi>Eaton</hi> School, and from thence choſen to <hi>King's</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge</hi> being about 20 years of Age, in the year 1626.

For beſides his conſtant and weekly labour of preaching, lie was very diligent and charitable in viſiting the ſick, and miniſtring not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpiritual counſel and comfort to them, but likewiſe liberal relief to the wants and neceſſities of thoſe that were poor and deſtitute of means to help themſelves in that condition. He did alſo every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning throughout the year Catechiſe in the Church, eſpecially the poorer ſort who were generally moſt ignorant; and to encourage them to come thither to be inſtructed by him he did once a week diſtribute money among them, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a certain day, but changing it on purpoſe as he thought good, that he might thereby oblige them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly preſent; Theſe were chiefly the more aged poor, who being paſt labour had leaſure enough to attend upon this exerciſe. As for the other ſort of poor who were able to work for their living, he ſet them at work upon his own charge, buying Flax and Hemp for them to ſpin, and what they ſpun he took off their hands paying them for their work, and then got it wrought into Cloth, and ſold it as he could, chiefly among his friends,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59936:103"/>himſelf bearing the whole loſs. And this was a very wiſe and well choſen way of charity, and in the good effect of it a much greater charity than if he had given theſe very perſons freely and for nothing ſo much as they earned by their work; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by this means he took many off from begging, and thereby reſcued them at once from two of the moſt dangerous temptations of this world, <hi>Idleneſs</hi> and <hi>Poverty;</hi> and by degrees reclaim'd them to a vertuous and induſtrious courſe of life, which enabled them afterwards to live without being beholden to the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of others.</p>
               <p>And this courſe ſo happily devis'd and begun by Mr. <hi>Gouge</hi> in his own Pariſh, was I think that which gave the firſt hint to that worthy and uſefull Citizen Mr. <hi>Thomas Firmin</hi> of a much larger deſign, which hath been proſecuted by him for ſome years with that vigour and good ſucceſs in this City, that many hundeds of poor Children, and others who liv'd idle before, unprofitable both to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the publick, are continually maintain'd at work and taught to earn their own livelihood much in the ſame way: He being, by the generous aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and charity of many worthy and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59936:104"/>well-diſpos'd Perſons of all ranks, enabled to bear the unavoidable loſs and charge of ſo vaſt an undertaking; and by his own forward inclination to charity, and his unwearied diligence and activity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily fitted to ſuſtain and go through the incredible pains of it.</p>
               <p>But to return to our deceaſed Friend; concerning whom I muſt content my ſelf to paſs over many things worthy to be remembred of him, and to ſpeak only of thoſe Vertues of his which were more eminent and remarkable.</p>
               <p>Of his Piety towards God, which is the neceſſary foundation of all other Graces and Vertues, I ſhall only ſay this, That it was great and exemplary, but yet very ſtill and quiet, without ſtir and noiſe, and much more in ſubſtance and reality, Than in ſhew and oſtentation; and did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in cenſuring and finding fault with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but in the due care and government of his own life and actions, and in <hi>exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> himſelf <hi>continually to have a conſcience void of offence toward God and toward men;</hi> in which he was ſuch a proficient, that even after a long acquaintance and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar converſation with him, it was not eaſie to obſerve any thing that might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve blame.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:59936:104"/>
               <p>He particularly excell'd in the more peculiar vertues of converſation, in <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, humility, meekneſs, cheerfulness,</hi> and in <hi>kindneſs</hi> and <hi>charity towards all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So great was his <hi>modeſty,</hi> that it never appear'd either by word or action, that he put any value upon himſelf. This I have often obſerv'd in him, that the Charities which were procur'd chiefly by his application and induſtry, when he had occaſion to give an account of them, he would rather impute to any one who had but the leaſt hand and part in the obtaining of them, than aſſume any thing of it to himſelf. Another inſtance of his modeſty was, that when he had quitted his Living of S. <hi>Sepulchres</hi> upon ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction about the terms of conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he willingly forbore preaching, ſaying there was no need of him here in <hi>London</hi> where there were ſo many worthy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and that he thought he might do as much or more good in another way which could give no offence. Only in the later years of his life, being better ſatisfi'd in ſome things he had doubted of before, He had Licenſe from ſome of the Biſhops to preach in <hi>Wales</hi> in his progreſs; which he was the more willing to do,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59936:105"/>becauſe in ſome places he ſaw great need of it, and he thought he might do it with greater advantage among the poor People, who were the more likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his inſtructions, being recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his great charity ſo well known to them, and of which they had ſo long had the experience and benefit. But where there was no ſuch need, he was very well contented to hear others per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to goodneſs and to practice it himſelf.</p>
               <p>He was <hi>clothed with humility,</hi> and had in a moſt eminent degree that <hi>ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>is in the ſight of God of ſo great price:</hi> So that there was not the leaſt appearance either of Pride or Paſſion in any of his words or actions. He was not only free from anger and bitterneſs, but from all affected gravity and moroſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. His converſation was affable and pleaſant; he had a wonderful ſerenity of mind and evenneſs of temper, viſible in his very countenance; he was hardly ever merry, but never melancholly and ſad; and for any thing I could deſcern, after a long and intimate acquaintance with him, he was upon all occaſions and accidents perpetually the ſame; always
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59936:105"/>cheerfull, and always kind; of a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ready to embrace and oblige all men; allowing others to differ from him, even in opinions that were very dear to him; and provided men did but <hi>fear God and work righteouſneſs,</hi> he lov'd them heartily, how diſtant ſoever from him in judgment about things leſs neceſſary; In all which he is very worthy to be a pattern to men of all Perſwaſions whatſoever.</p>
               <p>But that Vertue which of all other ſhone brighteſt in him, and was his moſt proper and peculiar character, was his cheerful and unwearied diligence in acts of pious Charity. In this he left far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him all that ever I knew, and , as I ſaid before, had a ſingular ſagacity and prudence in deviſing the moſt effectual ways of doing good, and in managing and diſpoſing his charity to the beſt purpoſes, and to the greateſt extent; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, if it were poſſible, making it to ſerve ſome end of Piety and Religion; as the inſtruction of poor children in the principles of Religion, and furniſhing grown perſons that were ignora n with the <hi>Bible</hi> and other good Books; ſtrictly obliging thoſe to whom he gave them to a diligent reading of them, and when he had opportunity exacting of them an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how they had profited by them.</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:59936:106"/>
               <p>In his occaſional alms to the poor, in which he was very free and bountiful, the relief he gave them was always min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with good counſel, and as great a tenderneſs and compaſſion for their ſouls as bodies; which very often attain'd the good effect it was likely to have, the one making way for the other with ſo much advantage, and men being very apt to follow the good advice of thoſe, who give them in hand ſo ſenſible a pledge and teſtimony of their good will to them.</p>
               <p>This kind of charity muſt needs be very expenſive to him, but he had a plentiful eſtate ſettled upon him and left him by his Father, and he laid it out as liberally in the moſt prudent and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ways of charity he could think of, and upon ſuch perſons as, all circumſtances conſidered, he judg'd to be the fitteſt and moſt proper objects of it.</p>
               <p>For about nine or ten years laſt paſt he did, as is well known to many here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, almoſt wholly apply his charity to <hi>Wales,</hi> becauſe there he judg'd was moſt occaſion for it: And becauſe this was a very great work, he did not only lay out upon it whatever he could ſpare out of his own eſtate, but employ'd his whole
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59936:106"/>time and pains to excite and engage the charity of others for his aſſiſtance in it.</p>
               <p>And in this he had two excellent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. One, to have poor children brought up to reade and write, and to be carefully inſtructed in the principles of Religion: The other, to furniſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of grown age, the poor eſpecially, with the neceſſary helps and means of knowledge, as the Bible, and other Books of piety and devotion, in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; to which end he procur'd the <hi>Church-Catechiſm,</hi> the <hi>Practice of Piety,</hi> and that beſt of Books the <hi>Whole Duty of Man,</hi> beſides ſeveral other pious and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Treatiſes,</hi> ſome of them to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into the <hi>Welch</hi> Tongue, and great numbers of all them to be printed, and ſent down to the chief Towns in <hi>Wales,</hi> to be ſold at eaſie rates to thoſe that were able to buy them, and to be freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to thoſe that were not.</p>
               <p>And in both theſe deſigns, through the bleſſing of God upon his unwearied en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, he found very great ſucceſs. For by the large and bountiful contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which chiefly by his induſtry and prudent application were obtain'd from charitable Perſons of all Ranks and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, from the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59936:107"/>
                  <hi>Wales</hi> and the neighbouring <hi>Counties,</hi> and ſeveral of that Quality in and about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> from divers of the Right Reverend <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and of the Clergy; and from that perpetual fountain of charity the City of <hi>London,</hi> led on and encourag'd by the moſt bountifull example of the Right Honourable the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> and the <hi>Court of Aldermen;</hi> to all which he conſtantly added two Thirds of his own eſtate, which as I have been credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd was two hundred pounds a year: I ſay, by all theſe together there were every year <hi>eight hundred,</hi> ſometimes a <hi>thouſand</hi> poor children educated as I ſaid before; and by this example ſeveral of the moſt conſiderable <hi>Towns</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> were excited to bring up at their own charge the like number of poor children, in the like manner, and under his inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and care.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe gave very great numbers of the Books above mention'd, both in the <hi>Welch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongues, to the poorer ſort, ſo many as were unable to buy them and willing to reade them. But which was the greateſt work of all, and amounted indeed to a mighty charge, he procured a new and very fair impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Bible and Liturgy of the Church
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59936:107"/>of <hi>England</hi> in the <hi>Welch</hi> Tongue (the former Impreſſion being ſpent, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly twenty of them to be had in all <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>) to the number of eight thouſand; one thouſand whereof were freely given to the poor, and the reſt ſent to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cities and Towns in <hi>Wales</hi> to be ſold to the rich at very reaſonable and low rates, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>four ſhillings</hi> a piece well bound and claſped; which was much cheaper than any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible was ever ſold that was of ſo fair a print and paper: A work of that charge, that it was not likely to have been done any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; And for which this Age, and perhaps the next, will have great cauſe to thank God oh his behalf.</p>
               <p>In theſe Good works he employed all his time and care and pains, and his whole heart was in them; ſo that he was very little affected with any thing elſe; and ſeldom either minded or knew any thing of the ſtrange occurrences of this trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bleſome and buſie Age, ſuch as I think are hardly to be parallel'd in any other: Or if he did mind them, he ſcarce ever ſpoke any thing about them. For this was the buſineſs he laid to heart, and knowing it to be ſo much and ſo certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Will of his heavenly Father, it was
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59936:108"/>his meat and drink to be doing of it: and the good ſucceſs he had in it was a continual feaſt to him, and gave him a perpetual ſerenity both of mind and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. His great love and zeal for this work made all the pains and difficulties of it ſeem nothing to him: He would riſe early and ſit up late, and continued the ſame diligence and induſtry to the laſt, though he was in the threeſcore and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth year of his Age. And that he might manage the diſtribution of this great charity with his own hands, and ſee the good effect of it with his own eyes, he always once, but uſually twice a year, at his own charge travelled over a great part of <hi>Wales,</hi> none of the beſt Countries to travel in: But for the love of God and men he endured all that, together with the extremity of heat and cold (which in their ſeveral ſeaſons are both very great there) not onely with patience but with pleaſure. So that all things conſidered there have not, ſince the primitive times of Chriſtianity, been many among the ſons of men to whom that glorious character of the Son of God might be better applied, that <hi>he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout doing good.</hi> And <hi>Wales</hi> may as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily boaſt of this truly Apoſtolical man
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59936:108"/>as of their famous St. <hi>David;</hi> who was alſo very probably a good man, as thoſe times of ignorance and ſuperſtition went. But his goodneſs is ſo diſguiſed by their fabulous <hi>Legends</hi> and ſtories which give us the account of him, that it is not eaſie to diſcover it. Indeed ridiculous mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in abundance are reported of him: as, that upon occaſion of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people reforming from all parts to hear him preach, for the greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his being heard, a mountain all on a ſudden roſe up miraculouſly under his feet, and his voice was extended to that degree that he might be diſtinctly heard for two or three miles round about. Such phantaſtical miracles as theſe make up a great part of his Hiſtory. And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting all theſe to be true (which a wiſe man would be loth to do) our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Friend had that which is much greater and more excellent than all theſe, a fervent charity to God and men; which is more than to <hi>ſpeak</hi> (as they would make us believe S. <hi>David</hi> did) <hi>with the Tongue of men and Angels,</hi> more than to raiſe or remove mountains.</p>
               <p>And now methinks it is pity ſo good a deſign ſo happily proſecuted ſhould fall and die with this good man. And it is
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59936:109"/>now under deliberation, if poſſible, ſtill to continue and carry it on, and a very worthy and charitable perſon pitched upon for that purpoſe, who is willing to undertake that part which he that is gone performed ſo well: But this will depend upon the continuance of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Charities and the concurrence of thoſe worthy and well-diſpoſed perſons in <hi>Wales</hi> to contribute their part as formerly; which I perſwade my ſelf they will cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do.</p>
               <p>I will add but one thing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our deceaſed Brother, that though he meddled not at all in our preſent heats and differences as a Party, having much better things to mind; yet as a looker on he did very ſadly lament them, and for ſeveral of the laſt years of his life he continued in the Communion of our Church, and, as he himſelf told me, thought himſelf obliged in conſcience ſo to do.</p>
               <p>He died in the 77th year of his age, <hi>Octob.</hi> 29th, 1681. It ſo pleaſed God that his death was very ſudden; and ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that in all probability he himſelf hardly perceived it when it happened, for he died in his ſleep; ſo that we may ſay of him as it is ſaid of <hi>David, after be had
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59936:109"/>ſerved his generation according to the will of God</hi> he fell aſleep.</p>
               <p>I confeſs that a ſudden death is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally undeſirable, and therefore with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we pray againſt it; becauſe ſo very few are ſufficiently prepared for it: But to him the conſtant employment of whoſe life was the beſt preparation for death that was poſſible, no death could be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; nay, it was rather a favour and bleſſing to him, becauſe by how much the more ſudden ſo much the more eaſie: As if God had deſigned to begin the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the great pains of his life in an eaſie death. And indeed it was rather a tranſlation than a death; and, ſaving that his body was left behind, what was ſaid of <hi>Enoch</hi> may not unfitly be applied to this pious and good man with reſpect to the ſuddenneſs of his change; <hi>he walked with God, and was not, for God took him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And God grant that we who ſurvive, may all of us ſincerely endeavour to tread in the ſteps of his exemplary piety and charity; of his labour of love, his unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried diligence and patient continuance in doing good, that we may meet with that encouraging commendation which he hath already received from the mouth
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59936:110"/>of our Lord. <hi>Well done good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that great ſhepherd of the ſheep, through the blood of the everlaſting covenant, make you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in every good work to do his will, working in you always that which is pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt; To whom be glory for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>THeſe Words contain one of the chief grounds of encouragement which the Chriſtian Religion gives us againſt the fear of death. For our clearer
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59936:111"/>underſtanding of them it will be requiſite to conſider the <hi>Context,</hi> looking back as far as the beginning of the <hi>Chapter;</hi> where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> purſues the argument of the foregoing <hi>Chapter;</hi> which was to comfort and encourage Chriſtians under their afflictions and ſufferings from this conſideration, that theſe did but prepare the way for a greater and more glorious reward; <hi>Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> And ſuppoſe the worst, that theſe ſufferings ſhould extend to death, there is comfort for us likewiſe in this caſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. of this <hi>Chapter, For we know that if our earthly houſe of this tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If our earthly houſe of this tabernacle;</hi> he calls our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy an <hi>earthly earthly houſe,</hi> and that we may not look upon it as a certain abode and fixed habitation, he doth by way of correction of himſelf add, that it is but a <hi>tabernacle</hi> or tent which muſt ſhortly be taken down: And when it is, <hi>we ſhall have a building of God, a houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</hi> This is a deſcription of our heavenly habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in oppoſition to our earthly houſe or tabern <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. It is <hi>a building of God,</hi> not
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59936:111"/>like thoſe houſes or tabernacles which men build, and which are liable to decay and diſſolution, to be taken down or to fall down of themſelves, for ſuch are thoſe houſes of clay which we dwell in <hi>whoſe foundations are in the duſt,</hi> but an habitation prepared by God himſelf, <hi>a houſe not made with hands;</hi> that which is the immediate work of God being in Scripture oppoſed to that which is made with hands and effected by humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence and by natural means: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the immediate work of God, as it is excellent, ſo it is laſting and durable, which no earthly thing is; <hi>eternal in the heavens,</hi> that is eternal and heavenly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For in this we groan earnestly;</hi> that is, while we are in this body we groan by reaſon of the preſſures and afflictions of it. <hi>Deſiring to be clothed upon with our houſe which is from heaven: If ſo be that being clothed we ſhall not be found naked. Deſiring to be clothed upon;</hi> that is, we could wiſh not to put off theſe bodies, not to be ſtripp'd of them by death, but to be of the number of thoſe who at the coming of our Lord without the putting off theſe bodies ſhall be changed and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed upon with their houſe which is from heaven, and without dying be inveſted
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59936:112"/>with thoſe ſpiritual and glorious and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodies which men ſhall have at the Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>This I doubt not is the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in theſe Words; in which he ſpeaks according to a common opinion among the Diſciples grounded (as St. <hi>John</hi> tells us) upon a miſtake of our Saviour's words concerning him, <hi>If I will that he tarry till I come:</hi> upon which St. <hi>John</hi> tells us that <hi>there went a Saying among the brethren that that diſciple ſhould not die;</hi> that is, that he ſhould live till Chriſt's coming to Judgment, and then be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and conſequently that Chriſt would come to Judgment before the end of that Age. Suitable to this common opinion among Chriſtians the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here ſays, <hi>in this we groan earneſtly, deſiring to be clothed upon with our houſe which is from heaven, if ſo be that being clothed we ſhall no be found naked.</hi> It hath puzzled <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters</hi> what to make of this paſſage, and well it might; for whatever be meant by being clothed, how can they that are clothed be found naked? But I think it is very clear that our <hi>Tranſlatours</hi> have not attained the true ſenſe of this paſſage, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is moſt naturally
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59936:112"/>rendred thus, <hi>if ſo be we ſhall be found clothed, and not naked:</hi> That is, if the coming of Chriſt ſhall find us in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and not deveſted of it; if at Chriſt's coming to Judgement we ſhall be found alive, and not dead. And then the ſenſe of the whole is very clear and current: we are deſirous to be clothed upon with our houſe from heaven (that is, with our ſpiritual and immortal bodies) if ſo be it ſhall ſo happen that at the coming of Chriſt we ſhall be found alive in theſe bodies, and not ſtripp'd of them before by death. And then it follows, <hi>For we burthened</hi> (that is, with the afflictions and preſſures of this life) <hi>not that we would be unclothed</hi> (that is, not that we deſire by death to be deveſted of theſe bodies) <hi>but clothed upon</hi> (that is, if God ſee it good we had rather be found alive, and changed, and without putting off theſe bodies have immortality as it were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduced) <hi>that ſo mortality might be ſwallowed up of life.</hi> The plain ſenſe is, that he rather deſires (if it may be) to be of the number of thoſe who ſhall be found alive at the coming of Chriſt, and have this mortal and corruptible body while they are clothed with it changed into a ſpiritual and incorruptible body,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59936:113"/>without the pain and terrour of dying: of which immediate tranſlation into heaven without the painfull divorce of ſoul and body by death, <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>It follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Now he that hath wrought for us the ſelf ſame thing is God:</hi> That is, it is he who hath fitted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared us for this Glorious change: <hi>who alſo hath given us the earneſt of the Spirit.</hi> The Spirit is frequently in Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>witneſs</hi> and <hi>ſeal</hi> and <hi>earneſt</hi> of our future happineſs and bleſſed reſurrection or change of theſe vile and earthly bodies into ſpiritual and heavenly bodies. For as the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead by the power of the holy Ghoſt is the great proof and evidence of immortality; ſo the ſpirit of him that raiſed up <hi>Jeſuſ</hi> from the dead dwelling in us is the pledge and earneſt of our Reſurrection to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal life.</p>
            <p>From all which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> concludes in the words of the <hi>Text, Therefore we are always confident,</hi> that is, we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of good courage againſt the fear of death, <hi>knowing that whilſt we are at home in the body we are abſent from the Lord,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be rendred <hi>whilſt we converſe</hi> or <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ in the body,</hi> than <hi>whilſt we are at
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59936:113"/>home;</hi> Becauſe the deſign of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is to ſhew that the body is not our houſe but our tabernacle; and that whilſt we are in the body we are not at home, but pilgrims and ſtrangers. And this notion the <hi>Heathens</hi> had of our preſent life and condition in this world. <hi>Ex vita diſcedo</hi> (faith <hi>Tully</hi>) <hi>tanquam ex hoſpitio non tanquam ex domo; commorandi enim natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra diverſorium nobis, non habitandi locum dedit. We go out of this life as it were from an Inn, and not from our home; nature having deſigned it to us as a place to ſojourn but not to dwell in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are abſent from the Lord;</hi> that is, we are detained from the bleſſed ſight and enjoyment of God, and kept out of the poſſeſſion of that happineſs which makes Heaven.</p>
            <p>So that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> makes an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate oppoſition between our continuance in the body, and our bliſsfull enjoyment of God; and lays it down for a certain truth, that whilſt we remain in the body we are detained from our happineſs, and that ſo ſoon as ever we leave the body we ſhall be admitted into it, <hi>knowing that whilſt we converſe in the body we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Lord.</hi> And <hi>ver</hi> 8. <hi>we are willing rather to be abſent from the body
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59936:114"/>and preſent with the Lord;</hi> intimating that ſo ſoon as we quit theſe bodies we ſhall be admitted to the bleſſed ſight and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God.</p>
            <p>My deſign from this <hi>Text</hi> is to draw ſome uſeful <hi>Corollaries</hi> or Concluſions from this Aſſertion of the <hi>Apoſtle, That whilſt we are in theſe bodies we are detained from our happineſs; and that ſo ſoon as ever we depart out of them we ſhall be admitted to the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of it.</hi> And they are theſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Aſſertion ſhews us the vanity and falſhood of that Opinion, or rather dream, concerning the ſleep of the Soul from the time of death till the general Reſurrection. This is chiefly grounded upon that frequent Metaphor in Scripture by which death is reſembled to ſleep, and thoſe that are dead are ſaid to be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len aſleep. But this Metaphor is no where in Scripture, that I know of, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the ſoul but to the body reſting in the grave in order to its being awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and raiſed up at the Reſurrection. And thus it is frequently uſed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs reference to the body, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59936:114"/>earth ſhall awake.</hi> Matth. 27.52. <hi>And the graves were opened, and many bodies of ſaints which ſlept aroſe.</hi> Acts 13.36. <hi>David after he had ſerved his own genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the will of God fell on ſleep, and was laid to his fathers and ſaw corruption;</hi> which ſurely can no otherwiſe be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood than of his body. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21. <hi>Now is Chriſt riſen from the dead and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the firſt-fruits of them that ſlept:</hi> that is, the reſurrection of his body is the earneſt and aſſurance that ours alſo ſhall be raiſed. And <hi>ver.</hi> 51. <hi>We ſhall not all ſleep, but ſhall all be changed;</hi> where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> certainly ſpeaks both of the death and change of theſe corruptible bodies. 1 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 4.14. <hi>If we believe that Jeſus died and roſe again, even ſo them alſo that ſleep in Jeſus ſhall God bring with him;</hi> That is, the bodies of thoſe that died in the Lord ſhall be raiſed, and accompany him at his coming. So that it is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which is ſaid in Scripture to ſleep, and not the ſoul. For that is utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Aſſertion here in the <hi>Text,</hi> that <hi>while we are in the body we are abſent from the Lord,</hi> and that ſo ſoon as we depart out of the body we ſhall be preſent with the Lord. For ſurely <hi>to be with the Lord</hi> muſt ſignifie a ſtate
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59936:115"/>of happineſs, which ſleep is not, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of inactivity: Beſides, that the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi>'s Argument would be very flat, and it would be but a cold encouragement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fear of death, that ſo ſoon as we are dead we ſhall fall aſleep and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inſenſible. But the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> uſeth it as an Argument why we ſhould be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to dye as ſoon as God pleaſeth, and the ſooner the better, becauſe ſo ſoon as we quit theſe bodies we ſhall be preſent with the Lord, that is, admitted to the bliſsful ſight and enjoyment of him; and while we abide in the body we are detained from our happineſs: But if our ſouls ſhall ſleep as well as our bodies till the general Reſurrection, it is all one whether we continue in the body or not, as to any happineſs we ſhall enjoy in the mean time; which is directly contrary to the main ſcope of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Aſſertion of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s doth perfectly conclude againſt the feigned Purgatory of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which ſuppoſeth the far greater number of true and faithful Chriſtians, of thoſe who dye in the Lord and have obtained eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by him from hell not to paſs
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59936:115"/>immediately into a ſtate of happineſs, but to be detained in the ſuburbs of Hell in extremity of torment (equal to that of hell for degree, though not for duration) till their fouls be purged, and the guilt of temporal punifhments, which they are liable to, be ſome way or other paid off and diſcharged. They ſuppoſe indeed ſome very few holy perſons (eſpecially thoſe who ſuffer Martyrdom) to be ſo perfect at their departure out of the body as to paſs immediately into Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they need no purgation: But moſt Chriſtians they ſuppoſe to dye ſo imperfect that they ſtand in need of being purged; and according to the degree of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection are to be detain'd a ſhorter or a longer time in Purgatory.</p>
            <p>But now, beſides that there is no <hi>Text</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi> from whence any ſuch ſtate can probably be concluded (as is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by many learned men of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) and even that <hi>Text</hi> which they have moſt inſiſted upon <hi>(they ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire)</hi> is given up by them as inſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clue the thing. <hi>Eſtius</hi> is very glad to get off it, by ſaying there is nothing in it againſt Purgatory: Why? no body pretends that, but we might reaſonably
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59936:116"/>expect that there ſhould be ſomething for it in a <hi>Text</hi> which hath been ſo often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and urged by them for the proof of it. I ſay, beſides that there is nothing in Scripture for Purgatory, there are a great many things againſt it, and utterly inconſiſtent with it. In the parable of the <hi>Rich man</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which was deſigned to repreſent to us the different ſtares of good and bad men in another world, there is not the leaſt intimation of Purgatory, but that good men paſs immediately into a ſtate of happineſs, and bad men into a place of torment. And St. <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 14.13. pronounceth all that dye in the Lord happy, becauſe <hi>they reſt from their labours;</hi> which they cannot be ſaid to do who are in a ſtate of great anguiſh and torment, as thoſe are ſuppoſed to be who are in Purgatory.</p>
            <p>But above all, this Reaſoning of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is utterly inconſiſtent with any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of ſuch a ſtate. For he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth all Chriſtians in general againſt the fear of death from the conſideration of that happy ſtate they ſhould immediately paſs into, by being admitted into the preſence of God; which ſurely is not Purgatory. <hi>We are of good courage</hi> (ſays he) <hi>and willing rather to be abſent from
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59936:116"/>the body:</hi> And great reaſon we ſhould be ſo, if ſo ſoon as we leave the body we are preſent with the Lord. But no man ſure would be glad to leave the body to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a place of exquiſite and extreme tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they tell us is the caſe of moſt Chriſtians when they dye. And what can be more unreaſonable, than to make the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to uſe an argument to comfort all Chriſtians againſt the ſear of death which concerns but very few in compariſon? So that if the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning be good, that while we are in this life we are detained from our happineſs, and ſo ſoon as we depart this life we paſs immediately into it, and therefore death is deſirable to all good men: I ſay, if this reaſoning be good, it is very clear that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> knew nothing of the Doctrine now taught in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Purgatory; becauſe that is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconſiſtent with what he expreſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts in this <hi>Chapter;</hi> and quite takes away the force of his whole Argument.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To encourage us againſt the fear of death. And this is the Concluſion which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> makes from this conſideration. <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſays he) <hi>we are of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, knowing that whilſt we converſe in the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59936:117"/>body we are abſent from the Lord.</hi> There is in us a natural love of life, and a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral horrour and dread of death; ſo that our ſpirits are apt to ſhrink at the thoughts of the approach of it. But this fear may very much be mitigated and even over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by Reaſon and the conſiderations of Religion. For death is not ſo dreadful in it ſelf, as with regard to the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it: And thoſe will be as we are, comfortable and happy to the good, but diſmal and miſerable to the wicked. So that the only true antidote againſt the fear of death is the hopes of a better life; and the only firm ground of theſe hopes is the mercy of God in <hi>Jefus Chriſt,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our due preparation for another world by repentance and a holy life. For the ſting of death is ſin; and when that is taken away the terrour and bitterneſs of death is paſt: And then death is ſo far from being dreadful, that in reaſon it is extremely deſirable; becauſe it lets us into a better ſtate, ſuch as only deſerves the name of life. <hi>Hi vivunt qui ex cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum vinculis tanquam è carcere evolave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt: veſtra vero quae dicitur vita, mors eſt. They truly live</hi> (could a <hi>Heathen</hi> ſay) <hi>who have made their eſcape out of this priſon of the body; but that which men
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59936:117"/>commonly call life is rather death than life.</hi> To live indeed, is to be well, and to be happy; and that we ſhall never be till we are got beyond the grave.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Conſideration ſhould comfort us under the loſs and death of Friends, which certainly is one of the greateſt grievances and troubles of humane life. For if they be fit for God, and go to him when they dye, they are infinitely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than it was poſſible for them to have been in this world: and the trouble of their abſence from us is fully balanced by their being preſent with the Lord. For why ſhould we lament the end of that life which we are aſſured is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of immortality? One reaſon of our trouble for the loſs of friends is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we loved them: But it is no ſign of our love to them to grudge and repine at their happineſs. But we hoped to have enjoyed them longer: Be it ſo; yet why ſhould we be troubled that they are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſooner than we expected? but they are parted from us, and the thought of this is grievous: But yet the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their being parted for a while is not near ſo ſad, as the hopes of a happy meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again, never to be parted any more,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59936:118"/>is comfortable and joyful. So that the greater our love to them was, the leſs ſhould be our grief for them, when we conſider that they are happy, and that they are ſafe; paſt all ſtorms, all the troubles and temptations of this life, and out of the reach of all harm and danger for ever. But though the Reaſon of our duty in this caſe be very plain, yet the practice of it is very difficult; and when all is ſaid, natural affection will have its courſe: And even after our Judgment is ſatisfied, it will require ſome time to ſtill and quiet our Paſſions.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This Conſideration ſhould wean us from the love of life; and make us not only contented but willing and glad to leave this world, whenever it ſhall pleaſe God to call us out of it. This Inference the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> makes, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>We are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I ſay, and willing rather to he abſent from the body, and preſent with the Lord.</hi> Though there were no ſtate of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity after this life, yet methinks we ſhould not deſire to live always in this world. <hi>Habet natura</hi> (ſays <hi>Tully</hi>) <hi>ut aliarum rerum, ſic vivendi modum: As na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ſet bounds and meaſures to other things, ſo likewiſe to life;</hi> of which men
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59936:118"/>ſhould know when they have enough, and not covet ſo much of it till they be tyred and cloyed with it. If there were no other inconvenience in long life, this is a great one, that in a long courſe of time we unavoidably ſee a great many things which we would not; our own misfortunes and the calamities of others; publick confuſions and diſtractions; the loſs of Friends and Relations; or which is worſe, their miſery; or which is worſt of all, their miſcarriage: Eſpecially, a very infirm and tedious old age is very undeſirable: For who would deſire to live long uneaſie to himſelf, and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to others? It is time for us to be willing to dye, when we cannot live with the good will even of our friends: when thoſe who ought to love us beſt think much that we live ſo long, and can hardly forbear to give us broad ſigns that they are weary of our company. In ſuch a caſe a man would almoſt be contented to dye out of civility; and not chuſe to make any long ſtay where he ſees that his company is not acceptable. If we think we can be welcome to a better place, and to a more delightful ſociety, why ſhould we deſire to thruſt our ſelves any longer upon an ill-natured world,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59936:119"/>upon thoſe who have much adoe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from telling us that our room is better than our company?</p>
            <p>Some indeed have a very happy and vigorous old age, and the taper of life burns clear in them to the laſt: Their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings are good, their memories and ſenſes tolerable, their humour plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and their converſation acceptable, and their Relations kind and reſpectful to them. But this is a rare felicity, and which ſeldome happens but to thoſe who have lived wiſely and vertuouſly, and by a religious and regular courſe of life have preſerved ſome of their beſt ſpirits to the laſt, and have not by vice and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance drawn off life to the dregs, and left nothing to be enjoyed but infirmities and ill humours, guilt and repentance: But on the contrary have prudently laid up ſome conſiderable comforts and ſupports for themſelves againſt this gloomy day; having ſtored their minds with wiſdom and knowledg, and taken care to ſecure to themſelves the comfortable reflexions of an uſeful and well-ſpent life, and the favour and loving-kindneſs of God which is better than life it ſelf. But generally the extremities of old age are very pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh and querulous, and a declining and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59936:119"/>falling back to the weak and helpleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Infancy and Childhood. And yet leſs care is commonly taken to pleaſe aged perſons, and leſs kindneſs ſhewed to them (unleſs it be in expectation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving greater from them) than to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: becauſe theſe are cheriſhed in hopes, the others in deſpair of their growing better. So that if God ſee it good it is not deſirable to live to try nature, and the kindneſs and good will of our Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the utmoſt.</p>
            <p>Nay there is reaſon enough why we ſhould be well contented to dye in any Age of our life. If we are young, we have taſted the beſt of it: If in our mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Age, we have not only enjoyed all that is deſirable of life, but almoſt all that is tolerable: If we are old, we are come to the dregs of it, and do but ſee the ſame things over and over again, and continually with leſs pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially if we conſider the happineſs from which we are all this while detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This life is but our Infancy and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in compariſon of the manly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and employments of the other ſtate. And why ſhould we deſire to be always children; and to linger here below to play the fools yet a little longer? In
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59936:120"/>this ſenſe that high expreſſion of the <hi>Poet</hi> is true.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Dii celant homines, ut vivere durent,</l>
               <l>Quàm ſit dulce mori—</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>The Gods conceal from men the ſweetneſs of dying, to make them patient and contented to live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This life is wholly in order to the other. Do but make ſure to live well, and there is no need of living long. To the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of preparation for another world, the beſt life is the longeſt. Some live a great pace, and by continual diligence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in ſerving God and doing good, do really diſpatch more of the buſineſs of life in a few years, than others do in a whole Age; who go ſuch a ſantring pace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, as if they were in no haſte to get thither. But if we were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prepared we ſhould rejoyce at the proſpect of our end; as thoſe who have been long toſt at Sea are overjoyed at the ſight of Land.</p>
            <p>I have now done with my <hi>Text,</hi> but have another Subject to ſpeak of; that excellent Man in whoſe Place I now
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59936:120"/>ſtand; whom we all knew, and whom all that knew him well did highly eſteem and reverence. He was born in <hi>Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> of a worthy and ancient Family, the 11th of <hi>March,</hi> 1609. was the ſixth Son of his Father: and being bred up to learning and very capable of it, was ſent to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there in <hi>Emanuel</hi> College, where he was choſen Fellow, and was an excellent Tutour and Inſtructour of Youth, and bred up many perſons of great Quality, and others, who afterwards proved uſeful and eminent; as many perhaps as any Tutour of that Time.</p>
            <p>About the age of four or five and thirty he was made Provoſt of <hi>King</hi>'s College; where he was a moſt vigilant and prudent Governour, a great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rager of Learning and good Order, and by his careful and wiſe management of the Eſtate of the College brought it into a very flouriſhing Condition, and left it ſo.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied (nor am I much concerned to diſſemble it) that here he poſſeſs'd another Man's place, who by the iniquity of the Times was wrongfully ejected; I mean Dr. <hi>Collins</hi> the famous and learned Divinity-Profeſſor of that
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59936:121"/>Univerſity. During whoſe life (and he lived many years after) by the free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the College there were two ſhares out of the common Dividend allotted to the Prevoſt, one whereof was conſtantly paid to Dr. <hi>Collins,</hi> as if he had been ſtill Prevoſt. To this Dr. <hi>Whichcot</hi> did not only give his conſent (without which the thing could not have been done) but was very forward for the doing of it, though hereby he did not only conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly leſſen his own profit, but likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr no ſmall cenſure and hazard, as the Times then were. And leſt this had not been kindneſs enough to that worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whoſe Place he poſſeſſed, in his laſt Will he left to his Son, Sir <hi>John Collins,</hi> a Legacy of one hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>And as he was not wanting either in reſpect or real kindneſs to the rightful Owner, ſo neither did he ſtoop to do any thing unworthy to obtain that Place; for he never took the <hi>Covenant:</hi> And not only ſo, but by the particular friendſhip and intereſt which he had in ſome of the chief of the <hi>Viſitours</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed to have the greateſt part of the Fellows of that College exempted from that Impoſition; and preſerved them in their Places by that means. And to the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59936:121"/>Fellows that were ejected by the <hi>Viſitours,</hi> he likewiſe freely conſented that their full Dividend for that year ſhould be paid them, even after they were ejected. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe was the Reverend and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Dr. <hi>Charles Maſon;</hi> upon whom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was ejected, the College did confer a good Living which then fell in their gift, with the conſent of the Prevoſt, who, knowing him to be a worthy man, was contented to run the hazard of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of thoſe Times.</p>
            <p>So that I hope none will be hard upon him, that he was contented upon ſuch terms to be in a capacity to do good in bad Times.</p>
            <p>For, beſides his care of the College, he had a very great and good influence upon the Univerſity in general. Every Lord's day in the Afternoon, for almoſt twenty years together, he preached in <hi>Trinity</hi> Church , where he had a great number not only of the young Scholars, but of thoſe of greater ſtanding and beſt repute for Learning in the Univerſity his conſtant and attentive Auditors: And in thoſe wild and unſetled Times contributed more to the forming of the Students of that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity to a ſober ſenſe of Religion than any man in that Age.</p>
            <pb n="238" facs="tcp:59936:122"/>
            <p>After he left <hi>Cambridge</hi> he came to <hi>London,</hi> and was choſen Miniſter of <hi>Black-Friars,</hi> where he continued till the dreadful Fire: And then retired himſelf to a Donative he had at <hi>Milton</hi> near <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge:</hi> where he Preached conſtantly; and relieved the poor, and had their children taught to read at his own charge; and made up differences among the neighbours. Here he ſtayed till, by the promotion of the Reverend Dr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> his Predeceſſour in this Place, to the <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> he was by his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and recommendation preſented to this Church. But during the building of it, upon the invitation of the Court of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, in the Mayoralty of Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Turner,</hi> he preached before that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Auditory at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> Chapel every Sunday in the afternoon with great acceptance and approbation, for about the ſpace of ſeven years.</p>
            <p>When his Church was built, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed his pains here twice a week, where he had the general love and reſpect of his Pariſh; and a very conſiderable and judicious Auditory, though not very numerous by reaſon of the weakneſs of his voice in his declining age.</p>
            <pb n="239" facs="tcp:59936:122"/>
            <p>It pleaſed God to bleſs him, as with a plentifull Eſtate, ſo with a charitable Mind: which yet was not ſo well known to many, becauſe in the diſpoſal of his charity he very much affected ſecrecy. He frequently beſtowed his alms (as I am informed by thoſe who beſt knew) on poor houſe-keepers diſabled by age or ſickneſs to ſupport themſelves, thinking thoſe to be the moſt proper objects of it. He was rather frugal in expence upon himſelf, that ſo he might have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to relieve the neceſſities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>And he was not onely charitable in his life, but in a very bountiful manner at his death; bequeathing in pious and charitable Legacies to the value of a thouſand pounds. To the Library of the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> fifty pounds: and of <hi>King's</hi> College one hundred pounds: and of <hi>Emanuel</hi> College twenty pounds: To which College he had been a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable benefactour before; having founded there ſeveral Scholarſhips to the value of a thouſand pounds, out of a Charity with the diſpoſal whereof he was entruſted, and which not without great difficulty and pains he at laſt recovered.</p>
            <pb n="240" facs="tcp:59936:123"/>
            <p>To the Poor of the ſeveral Places where his Eſtate lay, and where he had been Miniſter he gave above one hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>Among thoſe who had been his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or were ſo at his death, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in Annuities and Legacies in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the value of above three hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>To other charitable uſes and among the poorer of his Relations, above three hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>To every one of his Tenants he left a Legacy according to the proportion of the Eſtate they held, by way of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him: And to one of them that was gone much behind he remitted in his Will ſeventy pounds. And as became his great goodneſs, he was ever a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably kind Landlord, forgiving his Tenants, and always making abatements to them for hard years or any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental loſſes that happened to them.</p>
            <p>I muſt not omit the wiſe proviſion he made in his Will to prevent Law-ſuits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Legatees, by appointing two or three perſons of greateſt prudence and Authority among his Relations final Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators of all differences that ſhould ariſe.</p>
            <pb n="241" facs="tcp:59936:123"/>
            <p>Having given this account of his laſt Will, I come cow to the ſad part of all: ſad, I mean, to us, but happieſt to him. A little before <hi>Easter</hi> laſt he went down to <hi>Cambridge:</hi> where, upon taking a great Cold, he fell into a diſtemper which in a few days put a period to his life. He died in the houſe of his ancient and moſt learned Friend, Dr <hi>Cudworth,</hi> Maſter of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> College. During his ſickneſs he had a conſtant calmneſs and ſerenity of mind: and under all his bodily weakneſs poſſeſt his ſoul in great patience. After the Prayers for the Viſitation of the Sick. (which he ſaid were excellent Prayers) had been uſed, he was put in mind of receiving the Sacrament; to which he anſwered, that he moſt readily embraced the propoſal: And after he had received it, ſaid to Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> I heartily thank you for this moſt Chriſtian office: I thank you for putting me in mind of receiving this Sacrament: adding this pious ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>The Lord fulfill all his declarations and promiſes, and pardon all my weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and imperfections.</hi> He diſclaimed all merit in himſelf; and declared that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was, he was through the grace and goodneſs of God in <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:59936:124"/>He expreſſed likewiſe great diſlike of the Principles of Separation; and ſaid <hi>he was the more deſirous to receive the Sacrament that he might declare his full Communion with the Church of Chriſt all the world over.</hi> He diſclaimed <hi>Popery,</hi> and, as things of near affinity with it, or rather parts of it, <hi>all ſuperſtition, and uſurpation upon the conſiciences of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He thanked God, <hi>that he had no pain in his body, nor diſquiet in his mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Towards his laſt he ſeemed rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be detained any longer in this ſtate; not for any pains he felt in himſelf, but for the trouble he gave his friends: ſaying to one of them who had with great care attended him all along in his ſickneſs, <hi>My dear friend, thou haſt taken a great deal of pains to uphold a crazy body, but it will not do: I pray thee give me no more Cordials; for why ſhouldſt thou keep me any longer out of that happy ſtate to which I am going. I thank God I hope in his mercy, that it ſhall be well with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And herein God was pleaſed particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to anſwer thoſe devout and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighed petitions of his which he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed in his Prayer before Sermon, which I ſhall ſet down in his own words, &amp; I doubt not thoſe that were his conſtant
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59936:124"/>hearers do well remember them; <hi>And ſuperadd this, O Lord, to all the grace and favour which thou haſt ſhewn us all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in life, not to remove us hence but with all advantage for Eternity, when we ſhall be in a due preparation of mind, in a holy constitution of ſoul, in a perfect renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the guiſe of this mad and ſinful world, when we ſhall be intirely reſigned up to thee, when we ſhall have clear acts of faith in God by Jeſus Chriſt, high and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verential thoughts of thee in our minds, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged and inflamed affections towards thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And whenſoever we ſhall come to leave this world, which will be when thou ſhalt appoint (for the iſſues of life and death are in thy hands) afford us ſuch a mighty power and preſence of thy good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that we may have ſolid conſolation in believing, and avoid all conſternation of mind, all doubtfulneſs and uncertainty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our everlasting condition, and at length depart in the faith of God's Elect,</hi> &amp;c. Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.</p>
            <p>Thus you have the ſhort Hiſtory of the life and death of this eminent Perſon; whoſe juſt Character cannot be given in
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59936:125"/>few words, and time will not allow me to uſe many. To be able to deſcribe him aright it were neceſſary one ſhould be like him; for which reaſon I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf with a very imperfect draught of him.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not inſiſt upon his exemplary pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and devotion towards God, of which his whole life was one continued Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Nor will I praiſe his profound Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for which he was juſty had in ſo great reputation. The moral improvements of his mind, <hi>a Godlike temper and diſpoſition</hi> (as he was wont to call it) he chiefly valued and aſpired after; that univerſal charity and goodneſs, which he did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually preach and practiſe.</p>
            <p>His Converſation was exceeding kind and aſſable, grave and winning, prudent and profitable. He was ſlow to declare his judgment, and modeſt in delivering it. Never paſſionate, never peremptory: ſo far from impoſing upon others, that he was rather apt to yeild. And though he had a moſt profound and well-poized judgment, yet was he of all men I ever knew the moſt patient to hear others dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from him, and the moſt eaſie to be convinced when good Reaſon was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and, which is ſeldom ſeen, more
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59936:125"/>apt to be favourable to another man's Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than his own.</p>
            <p>Studious and inquiſitive men common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at ſuch an age (at forty or fifty at the utmoſt) have fixed and ſetled their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in moſt Points, and as it were made their <hi>laſt underſtanding;</hi> ſuppoſing they have thought, or read, or heard what can be ſaid on all ſides of things; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, they grow poſitive and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of contradiction, thinking it a diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to them to alter their judgment: But our deceaſed Friend was ſo wiſe, as to be willing to learn to the laſt; knowing that no man can grow wiſer without ſome change of his mind, without gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſome knowledge which he had not, or correcting ſome errour which he had before.</p>
            <p>He had attained ſo perfect a maſtery of his Paſſions, that for the latter and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of his life he was hardly ever ſeen to be tranſported with Anger: and as he was extremely carefull not to provoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, ſo not to be provoked by any; uſing to ſay, <hi>if I provoke a man he is the worſe for my company, and if I ſuffer my ſelf to be provoked by him I ſhall be the worſe for his.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="246" facs="tcp:59936:126"/>
            <p>He very ſeldom reproved any perſon in company otherwiſe than by ſilence, or ſome ſign of uneaſineſs, or ſome very ſoft and gentle word; which yet from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect men generally bore to him did often prove effectual: For he underſtood hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature very well, and how to apply himſelf to it in the moſt eaſie and effectual ways.</p>
            <p>He was a great encourager and kind directour of young Divines: and one of the moſt candid hearers of Sermons, I think, that ever was: So that though all men did mightily reverence his Judgment, yet no man had reaſon to fear his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. He never ſpake well of himſelf, nor ill of others: making good that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Panſa</hi> in <hi>Tully, neminem alterius, qui ſuae conſideret virtuti, invidere;</hi> that <hi>no man is apt to envy the worth and vertues of another, that hath any of his own to trust to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, he had all thoſe vertues, and in a high degree, which an excellent temper, great conſideration, long care and watchfulneſs over himſelf, together with the aſſiſtance of God's grace (which he continually implored, and mightily relied upon) are apt to produce. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly he excelled in the vertues of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59936:126"/>humanity, and gentleneſs, and humility, a prudent and peaceable and reconciling temper. And God knows we could very ill at this time have ſpared ſuch a Man; and have loſt from among us as it were ſo much balm for the healing of the Nation, which is now ſo miſerably rent and torn by thoſe wounds which we madly give our ſelves. But ſince God hath thought good to deprive us of him, let his vertues live in our memory, and his example in our lives. Let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be what he was, and we ſhall one day be what he now is, of bleſſed memory on Earth, and happy for ever in Heaven.</p>
            <p>And now methinks the conſideration of the Argument I have been upon, and of that great Example that is before us, ſhould raiſe our minds above this world and ſix them upon the glory and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the other. Let us then begin hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven here, in the frame and temper of our minds, in our heavenly affections and converſation; in a due preparation for, and in carneſt deſires and breathings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that bleſſed ſtate which we firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and aſſuredly hope to be one day poſſeſſed of: when we ſhall be removed
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59936:127"/>out of this ſink of ſin and ſorrows into the Regions of bliſs and immortality: where we ſhall meet all thoſe worthy and excellent perſons who are gone before us, and whoſe converſation was ſo delightfull to us in this world; and will be much more ſo to us in the other, when the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of juſt men ſhall be made perfect, and ſhall be quit of all thoſe infirmities which did attend and leſſen them in this mortal ſtate: when we ſhall meet again with our dear Brother, and all thoſe good men whom we knew in this world, and with the Saints and excellent perſons of all Ages to enjoy their bleſſed friendſhip and ſociety for ever, in the preſence of the bleſſed God where is <hi>fullneſs of joy, and at whoſe right hand are pleaſures for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a firm perſuaſion of this happy ſtate let us every one of us ſay with <hi>David,</hi> and with the ſame ardency of affection that he did, <hi>As the Hart panteth after the water brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee, O God: My ſoul thirsteth for God, for the living God; O when ſhall I come and appear before God?</hi> That ſo the life which we now live in this world may be <hi>a patient continuance in well doing</hi> in a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>expectation of the bleſſed hope and the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59936:127"/>glorious appearance of the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> To whom with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt be all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, now and for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus Christ, the great ſhepherd of the ſheep, through the blood of the everlaſting covenant, make us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in every good work to do his will; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in us always that which is well pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt; To whom be glory for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>MY deſign in this Argument is, from conſideration of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Sacrament of the <hi>Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:59936:129"/>and of the perpetual Uſe of it to the end of the world, to awaken men to a ſenſe of their duty, and the great obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which lies upon them to the more frequent receiving of it. And there is the greater need to make men ſenſible of their duty in this particular, becauſe in this laſt Age by the unwary diſcourſes of ſome concerning the nature of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament and the danger of receiving it unworthily, ſuch doubts and fears have been raiſed in the minds of men as utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do deter many, and in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to diſcourage almoſt the generality of Chriſtians from the uſe of it; to the great prejudice and danger of mens ſouls, and the viſible abatement of Piety by the groſs neglect of ſo excellent a means of our growth and improvement in it; and to the mighty Scandal of our Religion, by the general diſuſe and contempt of ſo plain and ſolemn an Inſtitution of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſhall take occaſion as briefly and clearly as I can to treat of theſe <hi>four</hi> Points.</p>
            <pb n="257" facs="tcp:59936:129"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> of this Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this the Apoſtle ſignifies when he ſaith, that <hi>by eating this Bread,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11 26.</note> 
               <hi>and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Cup, we do ſhew the Lord's Death till he come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of the <hi>Obligation</hi> that lies upon all Chriſtians to a frequent obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of this Inſtitution; this is ſignified in that expreſſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup:</hi> which expreſſion conſidered and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together with the practice of the Primitive Church, does imply an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon Chriſtians to the frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſatisfie the <hi>Objections</hi> and Scruples which have been raiſed in the minds of men, and particularly of many devout and ſincere Chriſtians, to their great diſcouragement from their receiving this Sacrament, at leaſt ſo frequently as they ought: which Objections are chiefly grounded upon what the Apoſtle ſays,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.27.</note> 
               <hi>Wherefore whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord unworthily, is guilty of the Body and Bloud of the Lord:</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What <hi>Preparation</hi> of our ſelves is neceſſary in order to our worthy receiving of this Sacrament: which will give me occaſion to explain the Apoſtle's meaning in thoſe Words,<note place="margin">Ver. 28.</note> 
               <hi>But let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I. For the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> of this Inſtitution, implyed in thoſe Words. <hi>For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew forth the Lord s Death till he come;</hi> or the Words may be read <hi>impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> and by way of Precept, <hi>ſhew ye forth the Lord's Death till he come.</hi> In the three <hi>verſes</hi> immediately before, the Apoſtle particularly declares the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Sacrament, with the manner and circumſtances of it, as he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it not only by the hands of the Apoſtles, but, as the Words ſeem rather to intimate, by immediate Revelation from our Lord himſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. For I have received of the Lord that which I alſo delivered unto you: that the Lord Jeſus in the ſame night that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed took Bread, and when he had given
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:59936:130"/>Thanks he brake it, and ſaid, take, eat, this is my Body which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me. After the ſame manner alſo he took the Cup when he had ſupped, ſaying, this Cup is the New Teſtament in my Bloud: this doe as often as ye ſhall drink it in remembrance of me. So that the Inſtitution is in theſe Words, <hi>this doe in remembrance of me.</hi> In which words our Lord commands his Diſciples after his Death to repeat theſe occaſions of <hi>taking</hi> and <hi>breaking</hi> and <hi>eating the Bread,</hi> and of <hi>drinking of the Cup,</hi> by way of ſolemn Commemoration of him. Now whether this was to be done by them once only, or oftner; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Diſciples only, during their lives, or by all Chriſtians afterwards in all ſucceſſive Ages of the Church, is not ſo certain merely from the force of theſe Words, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me:</hi> but what the Apoſtle adds puts the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of all doubt, that the Inſtitution of this Sacrament was intended not only for the Apoſtles, and for that Age, but for all Chriſtians, and for all Ages of the Chriſtian Church; <hi>For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's Death till he come:</hi> that is, untill the time of his ſecond coming,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59936:131"/>which will be at the end of the World. So that this Sacrament was deſigned to be a ſtanding Commemoration of the Death and Paſſion of our Lord till he ſhould come to Judgment; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Obligation that lies upon Chriſtians to the obſervation of it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, and ſhall never ceaſe to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>So that it is a vain conceit and mere dream of the <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> concerning the <hi>ſeculum Spiritûs Sancti, the Age</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſtion <hi>of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> when, as they ſuppoſe, all humane Teaching ſhall ceaſe, and all external Ordinances and Inſtitutions in Religion ſhall vaniſh, and there ſhall be no farther uſe of them. Whereas it is very plain from the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> that Prayer, and outward Teaching, and the Uſe of the two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, were intended to continue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians in all Ages. As for <hi>Prayer,</hi> (beſides our natural Obligation to this duty, if there were no revealed Religion) we are by our Saviour parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly exhorted to <hi>watch and pray,</hi> with regard to the day of Judgment, and in conſideration of the uncertainty of the time when it ſhall be: And therefore this will always be a Duty incumbent
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59936:131"/>upon Chriſtians till the day of Judgment, becauſe it is preſcribed as one of the beſt ways of Preparation for it. That <hi>outward Teaching</hi> likewiſe and <hi>Baptiſm</hi> were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be perpetual is no leſs plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt hath expreſly promiſed to be with the Teachers of his Church in the uſe of theſe Ordinances to the end of the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Go and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: and lo I am with you always to the end of the World.</hi> Not only to the end of that particular Age, but to the end of the Goſpel Age, and the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all Ages, as the phraſe clearly imports. And it is as plain, from this <hi>Text,</hi> that the <hi>Sacrament of the Lord's Supper</hi> was intended for a perpetual Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in the Chriſtian Church, till the ſecond coming of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> his coming to judgment: Becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that by theſe Sacramental Signs the Death of Chriſt is to be repreſented and comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morated till he comes. <hi>Doe this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me: For as oft as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's Death till he come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if this be the End and Uſe of this Sacrament, to be a ſolemn remembrance,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59936:132"/>of the Death and Sufferings of our Lord during his abſence from us, that is, till his coming to Judgment, then this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament will never be out of date till the ſecond coming of our Lord. The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whereof ſhould mightily ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and encourage our Faith in the hope of Eternal Life ſo often as we partake of this Sacrament: ſince our Lord hath left it to us as a memorial of himſelf till he come to tranſlate his Church into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and as a ſure pledge that he will come again at the end of the World and inveſt us in that Glory which he is now gone before to prepare for us. So that as often as we approach the Table of the Lord, we ſhould comfort our ſelves with the thoughts of that bleſſed time when we ſhall eat and drink with him in his Kingdom, and ſhall be admitted to the great Feaſt of the Lamb, and to eternal Communion with God the Judge of all, and with our bleſſed and glorified Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and the holy Angels, and the Spirits of juſt men made perfect.</p>
            <p>And the ſame conſideration ſhould likewiſe make us afraid to receive this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament unworthily, without due Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for it, and without worthy effects of it upon our Hearts and Lives. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59936:132"/>of that dreadfull Sentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation which at the ſecond coming of our Lord ſhall be paſt upon thoſe, who by the profanation of this ſolemn Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution trample under foot the ſon of God, and contemn the bloud of the Covenant; that Covenant of Grace and Mercy which God hath ratified with Mankind by the Bloud of his Son. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us that <hi>he that eateth and drinketh unworthily is guilty of the Body and Bloud of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>eateth and drinketh dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to himſelf.</hi> This indeed is ſpoken of temporal Judgment (as I ſhall ſhew in the latter part of this Diſcourſe,) but the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> likewiſe ſuppoſeth, that if theſe temporal Judgments had not their effect to bring men to Repentence, but they ſtill perſiſted in the Profanation of this holy Sacrament, they ſhould at laſt <hi>be condemned with the World.</hi> For as he that partaketh worthily of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment confirms his intereſt in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Goſpel, and his Title to eternal Life; ſo he that receives this Sacrament unworthily, that is without due Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and without fruits meet for it; nay, on the contrary, continues to live in ſin whilſt he commemorates the Death of Chriſt, <hi>who gave himſelf for us that he
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59936:133"/>might redeem us from all iniquity,</hi> this man aggravates and ſeals his own Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, becauſe he is guilty of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, not only by the contempt of it, but by renewing in ſome ſort the cauſe of his ſufferings, and as it were <hi>crucifying to himſelf afreſh the Lord of life and glory, and putting him to an open ſhame.</hi> And when the great Judge of the world ſhall appear and paſs final Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon men, ſuch obſtinate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent wretches as could not be wrought upon by the remembrance of the deareſt love of their dying Lord, nor be engaged to leave their ſins by all the tyes and obligations of this holy Sacrament, ſhall have their portion with <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> with the <hi>chief Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Souldiers,</hi> who were the betrayers and murtherers of the Lord of life and glory; and ſhall be dealt withall as thoſe who are in ſome ſort <hi>guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord.</hi> Which ſevere threatning ought not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men from the Sacrament, but to deter all thoſe from their ſins who think of engaging themſelves to God by ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and holy a Covenant. It is by no means a ſufficient Reaſon to make men to fly from the Sacrament, but certainly one of the moſt powerfull Arguments in
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59936:133"/>the world to make men forſake their ſins; as I ſhall ſhew more fully under the <hi>third</hi> head of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. The <hi>Obligation</hi> that lyes upon all Chriſtians to the frequent obſervance and practice of this Inſtitution. For though it be not neceſſarily implyed in theſe Words, <hi>as oft as ye eat this bread and drink this cup;</hi> yet if we compare theſe Words of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> with the uſage and practice of Chriſtians at that Time, which was to communicate in this holy Sacrament ſo often as they ſolemnly met together to worſhip God, they plainly ſuppoſe and recommend to us the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of this Sacrament, or rather imply an obligation upon Chriſtians to embrace all opportunities of receiving it. For the ſenſe and meaning of any Law or Inſtitution is beſt underſtood by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral practice which follows immediately upon it.</p>
            <p>And to convince men of their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereunto, and to engage them to a ſutable practice, I ſhall now endeavour with all the plainneſs and force of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion I can: And ſo much the more, becauſe the neglect of it among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59936:134"/>is grown ſo general, and a great many perſons from a ſuperſtitious awe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of this Sacrament are by degrees fallen into a profane neglect and contempt of it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall briefly mention a <hi>threefold</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation lying upon all Chriſtians to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Communion in this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; each of them ſufficient of it ſelf, but all of them together of the greateſt force imaginable to engage us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are obliged in point of <hi>indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable duty,</hi> and in obedience to a plain precept and moſt ſolemn inſtitution of our bleſſed Saviour that great <hi>Lawgiver, who is able to ſave and to deſtroy,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> calls him: He hath bid us <hi>doe this:</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> who declares nothing in this matter but what he tells us he <hi>received from the Lord,</hi> admoniſheth us to doe it often. Now for any man that profeſſeth himſelf a Chriſtian to live in the open and continued contempt or neglect of a plain Law and Inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is utterly inconſiſtent with ſuch a profeſſion. To ſuch our Lord may ſay as he did to the <hi>Jews, Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and doe not the things which I ſay?</hi> How far the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59936:134"/>Ignorance of this Inſtitution, or the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes which men have been led into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, may extenuate this neglect is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother conſideration. But after we know our Lord's will in this particular and have the Law plainly laid before us, there is no cloak for our ſin. For nothing can excuſe the wilfull neglect of a plain Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution from a downright contempt of our Saviour's Authority.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are likewiſe obliged hereunto in point of <hi>Intereſt.</hi> The benefits which we expect to be derived and aſſured to us by this Sacrament are all the bleſſings of the new Covenant, the forgiveneſs of our ſins, the grace and aſſiſtance of God's holy Spirit to enable us to perform the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Covenant required on our part; and the comforts of God's holy Spirit to encourage us in well-doing, and to ſupport us under ſufferings; and the glorious reward of eternal life. So that in neglecting this Sacrament we neglect our own intereſt and happineſs, we forſake our own mercies, and judge our ſelves unworthy of all the bleſſings of the Goſpel, and deprive our ſelves of one of the beſt means and advantages of confirming and conveying theſe bleſſings

               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:59936:136"/>to us. So that if we had not a due ſenſe of our <hi>duty,</hi> the conſideration of our own <hi>intereſt</hi> ſhould oblige us not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſo excellent and ſo effectual a means of promoting our own comfort and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We are likewiſe particularly obliged in point of <hi>gratitude</hi> to the carefull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of this Inſtitution. This was the particular thing our Lord gave in charge when he was going to lay down his life for us, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> Men uſe religiouſly to obſerve the charge of a dying friend, and, unleſs it be very difficult and unreaſonable, to doe what he deſires: But this is the charge of our beſt friend (nay of the greateſt friend and benefactour of all mankind) when he was preparing himſelf to dye in our ſtead and to offer up himſelf a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for us; to undergo the moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous pains and ſufferings for our ſakes, and to yield up himſelf to the worſt of temporal deaths that he might deliver us from the bitter pains of eternal death. And can we deny him any thing he asks of us who was going to doe all this for us? Can we deny him this? ſo little grievous and burthenſome in it ſelf, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59936:136"/>beneficial to us? Had ſuch a friend, and in ſuch circumſtances, bid us doe ſome great thing would we not have done it? how much more when he hath onely, ſaid, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me;</hi> when he hath only commended to us one of the moſt natural and delightfull Actions, as a fit repreſentation and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of his wonderfull love to us, and of his cruel ſufferings for our ſakes; when he hath only enjoyned us, in a thankfull commemoration of his goodneſs, to meet at his Table and to remember what he hath done for us; to look upon him whom we have pierced, and to reſolve to grieve and wound him no more? Can we with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the moſt horrible ingratitude neglect this dying charge of our Sovereign and our Saviour, the great friend and lover of ſouls? A command ſo reaſonable, ſo eaſie, ſo full of bleſſings and benefits to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obſervers of it!</p>
            <p>One would think it were no difficult matter to convince men of their duty in this particular, and of the neceſſity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving ſo plain an Inſtitution of our Lord; that it were no hard thing to perſuade men to their intereſt, and to be willing to partake of thoſe great and manifold bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which all Chriſtians believe to be
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59936:137"/>promiſed and made good to the frequent and worthy Receivers of this Sacrament. Where then lyes the difficulty? what ſhould be the cauſe of all this back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs which we ſee in men to ſo plain, ſo neceſſary, and ſo beneficial a duty? The truth is, men have been greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from this Sacrament by the unwary preſſing and inculcating of two great truths; <hi>the danger of the unworthy receiving of this holy Sacrament, and the neceſſity of a due preparation for it.</hi> Which brings me to the</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> III. <hi>Third</hi> Particular I propoſed, which was to endeavour to ſatisfie the <hi>Objections</hi> and <hi>Scruples</hi> which have been raiſed in the minds of men, and particularly of many devout and ſincere Chriſtians, to their great diſcouragement from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of this Sacrament, at leaſt ſo frequently as they ought. And theſe Objections, I told you, are chiefly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays at the 27th. <hi>verſe. Wherefore whoſoever ſhall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, is guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord.</hi> And again <hi>ver.</hi> 29. <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf.</hi> Upon the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59936:137"/>miſtake and miſapplication of theſe <hi>Texts</hi> have been grounded <hi>two</hi> Objections, of great force to diſcourage men from this Sacrament, which I ſhall endeavour with all the tenderneſs and clearneſs I can to remove. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the danger of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiving being ſo very great, it ſeems the ſafeſt way not to receive at all. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That ſo much preparation and worthineſs being required in order to our worthy Receiving, the more timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſort of devout Chriſtians can never think themſelves duly enough qualified for ſo ſacred an Action.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Obj. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note>1. That the danger of unworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving being ſo very great it ſeems the ſafeſt way wholly to refrain from this Sacrament and not to receive it at all. But this Objection is evidently of no force if there be (as moſt certainly there is) as great or a greater danger on the other hand, <hi>viz.</hi> in the neglect of this Duty: And ſo though the danger of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiving be avoided by not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, yet the danger of neglecting and contemning a plain Inſtitution of Chriſt is not thereby avoided. Surely they in the <hi>Parable</hi> that refuſed to come to the <hi>marriage-feaſt</hi> of the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Son</hi>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:59936:138"/>and <hi>made light</hi> of that gracious invitation were at leaſt as faulty as he who came <hi>without a wedding garment.</hi> And we find in the concluſion of the <hi>Parable,</hi> that as he was ſeverely puniſhed for his diſreſpect, ſo they were deſtroyed for their diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Nay of the two it is the greater ſign of contempt wholly to neglect the Sacrament, than to partake of it without ſome due qualification. The greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition that can be for this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is ones being a bad man, and he may be as bad, and is more likely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo, who wilfully neglects this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, than he that comes to it with any degree of reverence and preparation, though much leſs than he ought: And ſurely it is very hard ſor men to come to ſo ſolemn an Ordinance without ſome kind of religious awe upon their ſpirits, and without ſome good thoughts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, at leaſt for the preſent. If a man that lives in any known wickedneſs of life do before he receive the Sacrament ſet himſelf ſeriouſly to be humbled for his ſins, and to repent of them, and to beg God's grace and aſſiſtance againſt them; and after the receiving of it, does continue for ſome time in theſe good reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, though after a while he may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:59936:138"/>relapſe into the ſame ſins again; this is ſome kind of reſtraint to a wicked life; and theſe good moods and ſits of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and reformation are much better than a conſtant and uninterrupted courſe of ſin: even this <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> which is but <hi>as the morning cloud and the early dew which ſo ſoon paſſeth away,</hi> is better than none.</p>
            <p>And indeed ſcarce any man can think of coming to the Sacrament, but he will by this conſideration be excited to ſome good purpoſes, and put upon ſome ſort of endeavour to amend and reform his life: and though he be very much under the bondage and power of evil habits, if he do with any competent degree of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity (and it is his own fault if he do not) make uſe of this excellent means and inſtrument for the mortifying and ſubduing of his luſts and for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God's grace and aſſiſtence, it may pleaſe God by the uſe of theſe means ſo to abate the force and power of his luſts, and to imprint ſuch conſiderations upon his mind in the receiving of this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and preparing himſelf for it, that he may at laſt break off his wicked courſe and become a good man.</p>
            <p>But, on the other hand, as to thoſe who neglect this Sacrament, there is hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59936:139"/>thing left to reſtrain them from the greateſt enormities of life; and to give a check to them in their evil courſe: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the penalty of humane Laws, which men may avoid and yet be wicked enough. Heretofore men uſed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from great and ſcandalous vices by ſhame and fear of diſgrace, and would aſtain from many ſins out of regard to their honour and reputation among men: But men have hardned their faces in this degenerate Age, and thoſe gentle reſtraints of modeſty which governed and kept men in order heretofore ſignifie nothing now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days. Bluſhing is out of faſhion, and ſhame is ceaſed from among the Children of men.</p>
            <p>But the Sacrament did always uſe to lay ſome kind of reſtraint upon the worſt of mer: and if it did not wholly reform them, it would at leaſt have ſome good effect upon them for a time: If it did not make men good, yet it would make them reſolve to be ſo, and leave ſome good thoughts and impreſſions upon their minds.</p>
            <p>So that I doubt not but it hath been a thing of very bad conſequence, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men ſo much from the Sacrament, as the way hath been of late years: And that many men who were under ſome kind of check before, ſince they have been
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59936:139"/>driven away from the Sacrament have quite let looſe the reins, and proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves to all manner of impiety and vice. And among the many ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of our paſt confuſions; this is none of the leaſt, That in many Congregations of this Kingdom Chriſtians were generally difuſed and deterred from the Sacrament, upon a pretence that they were unfit for it; and being ſo, they muſt neceſſarily incur the danger of unworthy receiving; and therefore they had better wholly to abſtain from it. By which it came to paſs that in very many Places this great and ſolemn Inſtitution of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was almoſt quite forgotten, as if it had been no part of it; and the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſt's death even loſt among Chriſtians: So that many Congregations in <hi>England</hi> might juſtly have taken up the complaint of the Woman at our Saviour's Sepulchre, <hi>they have taken away our Lord, and we know not where they have laid him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſurely men did not well conſider what they did, nor what the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it would be, when they did ſo earneſtly diſſuade men from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 'Tis true indeed the danger of unworthy receiving is great; but the proper inference and concluſion from
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59936:140"/>hence is not that men ſhould upon this conſideration be deterred from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but that they ſhould be affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from their ſins, and from that wicked courſe of life which is an habitual indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and unworthineſs. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (as I obſerved before) truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents, and very much aggravates the danger of the unworthy receiving of this Sacrament; but he did not deter the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> from it, becauſe they had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times come to it without due reverence, but exhorts them to amend what had been amiſs and to come better prepared and diſpoſed for the future. And therefore after that terrible declaration in the Text, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, is guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord,</hi> he does not add, therefore let Chriſtians take heed of coming to the Sacrament, but, let them come prepared and with due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, not as to a common meal, but to a ſolemn participation of the body and bloud of Chriſt; <hi>but let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, if this be a good reaſon to abſtain from the Sacrament, for fear of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſo ſacred an action in an undue
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:59936:140"/>manner, it were beſt for a bad man to lay aſide all Religion and to give over the exerciſe of all the duties of piety, of prayer, of reading and hearing the Word of God; becauſe there is a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable danger in the unworthy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable uſe of any of theſe. <hi>The pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the wicked</hi> (that is, of one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to continue ſo) <hi>is an abomination to the Lord.</hi> And our <hi>Saviour</hi> gives us the ſame caution concerning hearing the Word of God; <hi>take heed how you hear.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that thoſe who are not reformed by the Doctrine of the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> it is <hi>the ſavour of death,</hi> that is dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and damnable; to ſuch perſons.</p>
            <p>But now will any man from hence ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that it is beſt for a wicked man not to pray, nor to hear or read the Word of God, leſt by ſo doing he ſhould endanger and aggravate his condemma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And yet there is as much reaſon from this conſideration to perſuade men to give over praying and attending to God's Word, as to lay aſide the uſe of the Sacrament. And it is every whit as true that he that prays unworthily and hears the Word of God unworthily, that is, without fruit and benefit, is guilty of a great contempt of God and of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:59936:141"/>Saviour; and by his indevout pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and unfruitfull hearing of God's Word does further and aggravate his own dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: I ſay, this is every whit as true, as that he that eats and drinks the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament unworthily is guilty of a high contempt of Chriſt, and <hi>eats and drinks his own Judgment;</hi> ſo that the danger of the unworthy performing this ſo ſacred an action is no otherwiſe a reaſon to any man to abſtain from the Sacrament, than it is an Argument to him to caſt off all Religion. He that unworthily uſeth or performs any part of Religion is in an evil and dangerous condition; but he that caſts off all Religion plungeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into a moſt deſperate ſtate, and does certainly damn himſelf to avoid the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of damnation: Becauſe he that caſts off all Religion throws off all the means whereby he ſhould be reclaimed and brought into a better ſtate. I cannot more fitly illuſtrate this matter than by this plain Similitude: He that eats and drinks intemperately endangers his health and his life, but he that to avoid this danger will not eat at all, I need not tell you what will certainly become of him in a very ſhort ſpace.</p>
            <pb n="279" facs="tcp:59936:141"/>
            <p>There are ſome conſcientious perſons who abſtain from the Sacrament upon an apprehenſion that the ſins which they ſhall commit afterwards are unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But this is a great miſtake; our Saviour having ſo plainly declared that all manner of ſin mall be forgiven men except the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt; ſuch as was that of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi> who as our Saviour tells us blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Holy Ghoſt in aſcribing thoſe great miracles which they ſaw him work, and which he really wrought by the Spirit of God, to the power of the Devil. Indeed to ſin deliberately after ſo ſolemn an engagement to the contrary is a great aggravation of ſin, but not ſuch as to make it unpardonable. But the neglect of the Sacrament is not the way to prevent theſe ſins; but, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the conſtant receiving of it with the beſt preparation we can is one of the moſt effectual means to prevent ſin for the future, and to obtain the aſſiſtence of God's grace to that end: And if we fall into ſin afterwards, we may be renewed by repentance; <hi>for we have an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who is the propitiation for our ſins;</hi> and as ſuch, is in a very lively and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59936:142"/>affecting manner exhibited to us in this bleſſed Sacrament of his body broken, and his bloud ſhed for the remiſſion of our ſins. Can we think that the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, who ſo frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this holy Sacrament, did never after the receiving of it fall into any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate ſin? undoubtedly many of them did; but far be it from us to think that ſuch ſins were unpardonable, and that ſo many good men ſhould becauſe of their carefull and conſcientious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of our Lord's Inſtitution unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably fall into condemnation.</p>
            <p>To draw to a concluſion of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſuch groundleſs fears and jealouſies as theſe may be a ſign of a good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but they are certainly a ſign of an injudicious mind. For if we ſtand upon theſe Scruples, no man perhaps was ever ſo worthily prepared to draw near to God in any duty of Religion, but there was ſtill ſome defect or other in the diſpoſition of his mind, and the degree of his preparation. But if we prepare our ſelves as well as we can, this is all God expects. And for our fears of falling into ſin afterwards, there is this plain anſwer to be given to it; that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of falling into ſin is not prevented
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59936:142"/>by neglecting the Sacrament, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crcaſed: becauſe a powerfull and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means of preſerving men from ſin is neglected. And why ſhould not every ſincere Chriſtian, by the receiving of this Sacrament and renewing his Covenant with God, rather hope to be confirmed in goodneſs, and to receive farther aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of God's grace and holy Spirit to ſtrengthen him againſt ſin, and to enable him to ſubdue it; than trouble himſelf with fears which are either without ground, or if they are not, are no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon to keep any man from the Sacrament? We cannot ſurely entertain ſo unworthy a thought of God and our bleſſed Saviour, as to imagine that he did inſtitute the Sacrament not for the furtherance of our Salvation, but as a ſnare, and an occaſion of our ruine and damnation. This were to pervert the gracious deſign of God, and to turn the cup of Salvation into a cup of deadly poiſon to the ſouls of men.</p>
            <p>All then that can reaſonably be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the danger of unworthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is, that upon this conſideration men ſhould be quickned to come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with a due preparation of mind, and ſo much the more to fortifie their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59936:143"/>of living ſutably to that holy Covenant which they ſolemnly renew every time they receive this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This conſideration ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of the abſolute neceſſity of a good life, but not to deter us from the uſe of any means which may contribute to make us good. Therefore (as a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Divine</hi> ſays very well) this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be neglected by none but thoſe that do not underſtand it, but thoſe who are unwilling to be tyed to their duty and are afraid of being engaged to uſe their beſt diligence to keep the commandments of Chriſt: And ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have no reaſon to fear being in a worſe condition, ſince they are already in ſo bad a ſtate. And thus much may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for anſwer to the <hi>firſt Objection</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the great danger of unworthy receiving this holy Sacrament. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Second Objection,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2.</note> which was this; That ſo much preparation and worthineſs being required to our worthy receiving, the more timorus ſort of Chriſtians can never think themſelves duly enough qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for ſo ſacred an Action.</p>
            <pb n="283" facs="tcp:59936:143"/>
            <p>For a full Anſwer to this Objection, I ſhall endeavour briefly to clear theſe <hi>three</hi> things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That every degree of Imperfection in our preparation for this Sacrament is not a ſufficient reaſon for men to refrain from it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That a total want of a due preparation, not only in the degree but in the main and ſubſtance of it, though it render us unfit at preſent to receive this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet it does by no means excuſe our neglect of it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the proper Inference and concluſion from the total want of a due preparation is not to caſt off all thoughts of receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but immediately to ſet upon the work of preparation that ſo we may be fit to receive it. And if I can clearly make out theſe <hi>three</hi> things, I hope this Objection is fully anſwered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That every degree of imperfection in our preparation for this Sacrament is not a ſufficient reaſon for men to abſtain from it: For then no man ſhould ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. For who is every way worthy, and in all degrees and reſpects duly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to approach the preſence of God in any of the duties of his Worſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? Who can <hi>waſh his hands in innocency,</hi>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:59936:144"/>that ſo he may be perfectly fit to approach God's Altar? <hi>There is not man on earth that lives and ſins not.</hi> The Graces of the beſt men are imperfect; and every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in grace and goodneſs is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in the diſpoſition and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of out minds for this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But if we do heartily repent of our ſins, and ſincerely reſolve to obey and perform the terms of the Goſpel, and of that Covenant which we entred into by Baptiſm, and are going ſolemnly to renew and confirm by our receiving of this Sacrament, we are at leaſt in ſome degree and in the main qualified to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this holy Sacrament; and the way for us to be more fit is to receive this Sacrament frequently, that by this ſpiritual food of God's appointing, by <hi>this living bread which comes down from heaven</hi> our ſouls may be nouriſhed in goodneſs, and new ſtrength and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue may be continually derived to us for the purifying of our hearts and enabling us to run the ways of God's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with more conſtancy and delight. For the way <hi>to grow in grace</hi> and to be <hi>ſtrengthned with all might in the inner man,</hi> and to <hi>abound in all the fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which by Chriſt Jeſus are to the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59936:144"/>praiſe and glory of God,</hi> is with care and conſcience to uſe thoſe means which God hath appointed for this end: And if we will neglect the uſe of theſe means it is to no purpoſe for us to pray to God for his grace and aſſiſtence. We may tire our ſelves with our devotions and fill heaven with vain complaints, and yet by all this importunity obtain nothing at God's hand: Like lazy beggars that are always complaining and always ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but will not work, will do nothing to help themſelves and better their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and therefore are never like to move the pity and compaſſion of others. If we expect God's grace and aſſiſtence, we muſt work out our own Salvation in the carefull uſe of all thoſe means which God hath appointed to that end. That excellent degree of goodneſs which men would have to fit them for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not to be had but by the uſe of it. And therefore it is a prepoſterous thing for men to inſiſt upon having the end before they will uſe the means that may further them in the obtaining of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The total want of a due preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not only in the degree but in the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59936:145"/>main and ſubſtance of if, though it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us unfit at preſent to receive this Sacrament, yet does it by no means ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe our neglect of it. One fault may draw on another, but can never excuſe it. It is our great fault that we are wholly unprepared, and no man can claim any benefit by his fault, or plead it in excuſe or extenuation of this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. A total want of preparation and an abſolute unworthineſs is Impenitency in an evil courſe, a reſolution to continue a bad man, not to quit his luſts and to break off that wicked courſe he hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in: But is this any excuſe for the neglect of our duty that we will not fit our ſelves for the doing of it with bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and advantage to our ſelves? A father commands his ſon to ask him bleſſing every day, and is ready to give it him; but ſo long as he is undutifull to him in his other actions, and lives in open diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, forbids him to come in his ſight. He excuſeth himſelf from asking his father bleſſing, becauſe he is unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in other things, and reſolves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo. This is juſt the caſe of neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duty God requires, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings he offers to us in the Sacrament, becauſe we have made our ſelves incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59936:145"/>of ſo performing the one as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the other; and are reſolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo. We will not do our duty in other things, and then plead that we are unfit and unworthy to do it in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The proper Inference and concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from a total want of due preparation for the Sacrament is not to caſt off all thoughts of receiving it, but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to ſet about the work of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that ſo we may be fit to receive it. For if this be true, that they who are abſolutely unprepared ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament, nor can do it with any benefit; nay by doing it in ſuch a manner render their condition much worſe, this is a moſt forcible argument to repentance and amendment of life: There is nothing reaſonable in this caſe but immediately to reſolve upon a better courſe, that ſo we may be meet parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of thoſe holy Myſteries, and may no longer provoke God's wrath againſt us by the wilfull neglect of ſo great and neceſſary a duty of the Chriſtian Religion. And we do wilfully neglect it, ſo long as we do wilfully refuſe to fit and qualifie our ſelves for the due and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59936:146"/>performance of it. Let us view the thing in a like caſe; A Pardon is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly offered to a Rebel, he declines to accept it, and modeſtly excuſeth himſelf becauſe he is not worthy of it. And why is he not worthy? becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to be a Rebel, and then his pardon will do him no good, but be an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his crime. Very true: and it will be no leſs an aggravation that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth it for ſuch a reaſon, and under a pretence of modeſty does the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent thing in the world. This is juſt the caſe; and in this caſe there is but one thing reaſonable to be done, and that is, for a man to make himſelf capable of the benefit as ſoon as he can, and thankfully to accept of it: but to excuſe himſelf from accepting of the benefit offered, becauſe he is not worthy of it, nor fit for it, nor ever intends to be ſo, is as if a man ſhould deſire to be excuſed from being happy becauſe he is reſolved to play the fool and to be miſerable. So that whether our want of preparation be total, or only to ſome degree, it is every way unreaſonable: If it be in the degree only, it ought not to hinder us from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament; If it be total, it ought to put us immediately upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59936:146"/>the impediment, by making ſuch preparation as is neceſſary to the due and worthy receiving of it. And this brings me to the</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> IV. <hi>Fourth</hi> and laſt thing I propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> What preparation of our ſelves is neceſſary in order to the worthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of this Sacrament. Which I told you would give me occaſion to explain the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s meaning in the laſt part of the <hi>Text, But let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.</hi> I think it very clear from the occaſion and circumſtances of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi>'s diſcourſe concerning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he does not intend the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our ſtate, whether we be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians or not, and ſincerely reſolved to continue ſo; and conſequently that he does not here ſpeak of our habitual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration by the reſolution of a good life. This he takes for granted, that they were Chriſtians and reſolved to continue and perſevere in their Chriſtian profeſſion: But he ſpeaks of their actual fitneſs and worthineſs at that time when they came to receive the Lord's Supper. And for the clearing of this matter, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what it was that gave occaſion to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59936:147"/>this diſcourſe. At the 20th <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter</hi> he ſharply reproves their irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and unſutable carriage at the Lord's Supper. They came to it very diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>one before another.</hi> It was the cuſtom of Chriſtians to meet at their <hi>Feaſt of Charity,</hi> in which they did communicate with great ſobriety and temperance; and when that was ended they celebrated the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Now among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> this order was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: The rich met and excluded the poor from this common Feaſt. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an irregular feaſt (one before another eating his own ſupper as he came) they went to the Sacrament in great diſorder; <hi>one was hungry</hi> having eaten nothing at all, <hi>others were drunk,</hi> having eaten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperately; and the poor were deſpiſed and neglected. This the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns as a great profanation of that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Inſtitution of the Sacrament; at the participation whereof they behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with as little reverence as if they had been met at a common ſupper or feaſt. And this he calls <hi>not diſcerning the Lord's body,</hi> making no difference in their behaviour between the Sacrament, and a common meal: which irreverent and contemptuous carriage of theirs he
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59936:147"/>calls <hi>eating and drinking unworthily:</hi> for which he pronounceth them <hi>guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord,</hi> which were repreſented and commemorated in their <hi>eating of that bread and drinking of that cup.</hi> By which irreverent and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous uſage of the body and bloud of our Lord, he tells them that they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the Judgment of God; which he calls <hi>eating and drinking their own judgment.</hi> For that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which our <hi>Tranſlatours</hi> render <hi>damnation,</hi> does not here ſignifie eternal condemnation, but a temporal judgment and chaſtiſement in order to the prevention of eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, is evident from what follows; <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himſelf:</hi> And then he ſays, <hi>For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep:</hi> That is, for this irreverence of theirs God had ſent among them ſeveral diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, of which many had dyed. And then he adds, <hi>For if we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged. If we would judge our ſelves;</hi> whether this be meant of the publick Cenſures of the Church, or our private cenſuring of our ſelves in order to our future amendment and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, is not certain. If of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59936:148"/>which I think moſt probable, then <hi>judging</hi> here is much the ſame with <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining our ſelves, ver.</hi> 28. And then the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s meaning is, that if we would cenſure and examine our ſelves, ſo as to be more carefull for the future, we ſhould eſcape the judgment of God in theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhments. <hi>But when we are jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the world. But when we are judged;</hi> that is, when by neglecting thus to judge our ſelves we provoke God to judge us; <hi>we are chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord, that we ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the world;</hi> that is, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts theſe temporal judgments upon us to prevent our eternal condemnation. Which plainly ſhews, that the judgment here ſpoken of is not eternal condemnation. And then he concludes, <hi>Wherefore, my Brethren, when ye come together to eat tarry for one another. And if any man hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, let him eat at home, that ye come not together unto judgment:</hi> where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> plainly ſhews both what was the crime of unworthy receiving, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. Their crime was, their irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent and diſorderly participation of the Sacrament; and their puniſhment was, thoſe temporal judgments which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:59936:148"/>upon them for this their contempt of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Now this being, I think, very plain; we are proportionably to underſtand the precept of examination of our ſelves <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we eat of that bread and drink of that cup. But let a man examine himſelf;</hi> that is, conſider well with himſelf what a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Action he is going about, and what behaviour becomes him when he is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating this Sacrament inſtituted by our Lord in memorial of his body and bloud, that is, of his death and paſſion: And if heretofore he have been guilty of any diſorder and irreverence (ſuch as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> here taxeth them withall) let him cenſure and <hi>judge himſelf</hi> for it, be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of and ſorry for his fault, and be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to avoid it for the future; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus <hi>examined himſelf, let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.</hi> This, I think, is the plain ſenſe of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Diſcourſe; and that if we attend to the ſcope and circumſtances of it, it cannot well have any other meaning.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, Is this all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration that is required to our worthy receiving of the Sacrament, that we take care not to come drunk to it, nor to be guilty of any irreverence and diſorder in
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:59936:149"/>the celebration of it? I anſwer in ſhort, this was the particular unworthineſs with which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> taxeth the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> and which he warns them to amend, as they deſire to eſcape the judgments of God, ſuch as they had already felt for this irreverent carriage of theirs, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutable to the holy Sacrament: He finds no other fault with them at preſent in this matter, though any other fort of ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverence will proportionably expoſe men to the like puniſhment. He ſays no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here of their habitual preparation, by the ſincere purpofe and reſolution of a good life anſwerable to the rules of the Chriſtian Religion: This we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he took for granted. However, it concerns the Sacrament no more than it does Prayer or any other religious duty. Not but that it is very true that none but thoſe who do heartily embrace the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion and are ſincerely reſolved to frame their lives according to the holy rules and precepts of it, are fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in this ſolemn acknowledgment and profeſſion of it. So that it is a practice very much to be countenanced and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, becauſe it is of great uſe, for Chriſtians by way of preparation for the Sacrament to examine themſelves in
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:59936:149"/>a larger ſenſe than in all probability the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here intended: I mean, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our paſt lives and the actions of them in order to a ſincere repentance of all our errours and miſcarriages, and to fix us in the ſteady purpoſe and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a better life: particularly, when we expect to have the forgiveneſs of our ſins ſealed to us, we ſhould lay aſide all enmity and thoughts of revenge, and heartily forgive thoſe that have offended us, and put in practice that univerſal love and charity which is repreſented to us by this holy Communion. And to this purpoſe we are earneſtly exhorted in the publick <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Communion</hi> by way of due preparation and diſpoſition for it, to <hi>repent us truly of our ſins paſt, to amend our lives, and to be in perfect charity with all men, that ſo we may be meet partakers of thoſe holy myſteries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe this work of examining our ſelves concerning our ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and of exerciſing repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and charity towards men is incumbent upon us as we are Chriſtians, and can never be put in practice more ſeaſonably and with greater advantage than when we are meditating of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, therefore beſides our habitual
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59936:150"/>preparation by repentance and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant endeavours of a holy life, it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pious and commendable cuſtome in Chriſtians before their coming to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to ſet apart ſome particular time for this work of examination. But how much time every perſon ſhould allot to this purpoſe, is matter of prudence; and as it need not, ſo neither indeed can it be preciſely determined. Some have greater reaſon to ſpend more time upon this work, than others; I mean thoſe whoſe accounts are heavier, becauſe they have long run upon the ſcore and neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves: And ſome alſo have more leiſure and freedom for it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their caſie condition and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the world; and therefore are obliged to allow a greater portion of Time for the exerciſes of piety and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In general, no man ought to doe a work of ſo great moment and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſlightly and perfunctorily. And in this, as in all other actions, the end is principally to be regarded. Now the end of examining our ſelves is to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand our ſlate and condition, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form whatever we find amiſs in our ſelves. And provided this end be obtained, the circumſtances of the means are leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable:
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59936:150"/>whether more or leſs time be allowed to this work it matters not ſo much, as to make ſure that the work be throughly done.</p>
            <p>And I do on purpoſe ſpeak thus cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in this matter, becauſe ſome pious perſons do perhaps err on the ſtricter hand, and are a little ſuperſtitious on that ſide; inſomuch that unleſs they can gain ſo much time to ſet apart for a ſolemn preparation, they will refrain from the Sacrament at that time; though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they be habitually prepared. This I doubt not proceeds from a pious mind; but as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays in another caſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sacrament, <hi>ſhall I praiſe them in this? I praiſe them not.</hi> For, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there be no wilfull neglect of due preparation, it is much better to come ſo prepared as we can, nay I think it is our duty ſo to doe, rather than to abſtain upon this <hi>punctilio.</hi> For when all is done, the beſt preparation for the Sacrament is the general care and endeavour of a good life: And he that is thus prepared may receive at any time when opportunity is offered, though he had no particular fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of that opportunity. And I think in that caſe ſuch a one ſhall do much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to receive than to refrain; becauſe he
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59936:151"/>is habitually prepared for the Sacrament, though he had no time to make ſuch actual preparation as he deſired. And if this were not allowable how could Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters communicate with ſick perſons at all times, or perſuade others to doe it many times upon very ſhort and ſudden warning?</p>
            <p>And indeed we cannot imagine that the primitive Chriſtians, who received the Sacrament ſo frequently that for ought appears to the contrary they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as eſſential and neceſſary a part of their publick worſhip as any other part of it whatſoever, even as their Hymns and Prayers, and reading and interpreting the Word of God: I ſay, we cannot well conceive how they who celebrated it ſo conſtantly, could allot any more time for a ſolemn preparation for it, than they did for any other part of divine worſhip: And conſequently, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> when he bids the <hi>Corinthians</hi> examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could mean no more than that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidering the nature and ends of this Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution they ſhould come to it with great reverence; and reflecting upon their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer miſcarriages in this matter, ſhould be carefull upon this admonition to avoid them for the future and to amend what
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59936:151"/>had been amiſs: which to doe, requires rather reſolution and care than any long time of preparation.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak this, that devout perſons may not be entangled in an apprehenſion of a greater neceſſity than really there is of a long and ſolemn preparation every time they receive the Sacrament. The great neceſſity that lies upon men is to live as becomes Chriſtians, and then they can never be abſolutely unprepared. Nay, I think this to be a very good preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and I ſee not why men ſhould not be very well ſatisfied with it, unleſs they intend to make the ſame uſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that many of the Papiſts do of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Abſolution, which is to quit with God once or twice a year, that ſo they may begin to ſin again upon a new ſcore.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Examination of our ſelves is a thing ſo very uſefull, and the time which men are wont to ſet apart for their preparation for the Sacrament is ſo advantageous an opportunity for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it; therefore I cannot but very much commend thoſe who take this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſearch and try their ways, and to call themſelves to a more ſolemn ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their actions. Becauſe this ought
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:59936:152"/>to be done ſometime, and I know no fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time for it than this. And perhaps ſome would never find time to recollect themſelves and to take the condition of their ſouls into ſerious conſideration, were it not upon this ſolemn occaſion.</p>
            <p>The ſumm of what I have ſaid is this, that ſuppoſing a perſon to be habitually prepared by a religious diſpoſition of mind and the general courſe of a good life, this more ſolemn actual preparation is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways neceſſary: And it is better when there is an opportunity to receive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, than not to receive at all. But the greater our actual preparation is, the better. For no man can examine himſelf too often, and underſtand the ſtate of his ſoul too well, and exerciſe repentance, and renew the reſolutions of a good life too frequently. And there is perhaps no fitter opportunity for the doing of all this, than when we approach the Lord's table, there to commemorate his death, and to renew our Covenant with him to live as becomes the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>All the Reflexion I ſhall now make up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Diſcourſe, ſhall be from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of what hath been ſaid earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to excite all that profeſs and call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59936:152"/>Chriſtians to a due preparation of themſelves for this holy Sacrament, and a frequent participation of it according to the intention of our Lord and Saviour in the inſtitution of it, and the undoubted practice of Chriſtians in the primitive and beſt times, when men had more devotion and fewer ſcruples about their duty.</p>
            <p>If we do in good earneſt believe that this Sacrament was inſtituted by our Lord in remembrance of his dying love, we cannot but have a very high value and eſteem for it upon that account. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks ſo often as we reade in the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of it thoſe words of our dear Lord, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what he who ſaid them did for us, this dying charge of our beſt friend ſhould ſtick with us and make a ſtrong impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon our minds: Eſpecially if we add to theſe, thoſe other words of his, not long before his death, <hi>Greater love than this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friend; ye are my friends if ye do whatſoever I command you.</hi> It is a wonderfull love which he hath expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to us, and worthy to be had in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual remembrance. And all that he expects from us, by way of thankfull acknowledgment, is to celebrate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59936:153"/>of it by the frequent partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of this bleſſed Sacrament. And ſhall this charge, laid upon us by him who laid down his life for us, lay no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon us to the ſolemn remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that unparallel'd kindneſs which is the fountain of ſo many bleſſings and benefits to us? It is a ſign we have no great ſenſe of the benefit when we are ſo unmindfull of our benefactour as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him days without number. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation he hath laid upon us is ſo vaſtly great, not only beyond all requital but beyond all expreſſion, that if he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us ſome very grievous thing we ought with all the readineſs and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in the world to have done it; how much more when he hath impoſed upon us ſo eaſie a commandment, a thing of no burthen but of immence benefit? when he hath onely ſaid to us, <hi>Eat O friends, and drink O beloved?</hi> when he onely invites us to his table, to the beſt and moſt delicious Feaſt that we can par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of on this ſide heaven?</p>
            <p>If we ſeriouſly believe the great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which are there exhibited to us and ready to be conferred upon us, we ſhould be ſo far from neglecting them, that we ſhould heartily thank God for every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59936:153"/>he offers to us of being made partakers of ſuch benefits. When ſuch a price is put into our hands, ſhall we want hearts to make uſe of it? Methinks we ſhould long with <hi>David</hi> (who ſaw but the ſhadow of theſe bleſſings) to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the good things of God's houſe, and to draw near his altar; and ſhould cry out with him, <hi>O when ſhall I come and appear before thee! My ſoul longeth, yea even fainteth for the courts of the Lord, and my fleſh cryeth out for the living God.</hi> And if we had a juſt eſteem of things, we ſhould account it the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt infelicity and judgment in the world to be debarred of this privilege, which yet we do deliberately and frequently deprive our ſelves of.</p>
            <p>We exclaim againſt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with great impatience, and with a very juſt indignation, for robbing the People of half of this bleſſed Sacrament, and taking from them the <hi>cup of bleſſing, the cup of ſalvation;</hi> and yet we can pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently endure for ſome months, nay years, to exclude our ſelves wholly from it. If no ſuch great benefits and bleſſings belong to it, why do we complain of them for hindring us of any part of it? But if there do, why do we by our own
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59936:154"/>neglect deprive our ſelves of the whole?</p>
            <p>In vain do we bemoan the decay of our graces and our ſlow progreſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in Chriſtianity, whilſt we wilfully deſpiſe the beſt means of our growth in goodneſs. Well do we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that God ſhould ſend leanneſs into our ſouls, and make them to conſume and pine away in perpetual doubting and trouble, if, when God himſelf doth ſpread ſo bountifull a Table for us and ſet before us the bread of life, we will not come and feed upon it with joy and thankfulneſs.</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE AGAINST <hi>TRANS<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>BSTANTIATION.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> one of the two great poſitive Inſtitutions of the Chriſtian Religion, there are two main Points of difference between <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome. One,</hi> about the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> in which they think, but are not certain, that they have the Scripture and the words of our Saviour on their ſide: The <hi>other,</hi> about the adminiſtration of this Sacrament to the People in both kinds? in which we are ſure that we have the Scripture and our Saviour's Inſtitution on
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59936:155"/>our ſide; and that ſo plainly that our Adverſaries themſelves do not deny it.</p>
            <p>Of the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe I ſhall now treat, and endeavour to ſhew againſt the Church of <hi>Rome, That in this Sacrament, there is no ſubſtantial change made of the Elements of Bread and Wine into the natural Body and Bloud of Chriſt;</hi> that <hi>Body</hi> which was born of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Croſs; for ſo they explain that hard word <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I engage in this Argument, I cannot but obſerve what an unreaſonable task we are put upon, by the bold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of our Adverſaries, to diſpute a matter of Senſe; which is one of thoſe things about which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath long ſince pronounc'd there ought to be no diſpute.</p>
            <p>It might well ſeem ſtrange if any man ſhould write a Book, to prove that an <hi>Egg</hi> is not an <hi>Elephant,</hi> and that a <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-bullet</hi> is not a <hi>Pike:</hi> It is every whit as hard a caſe, to put to maintain by a long Diſcourſe, that what we ſee and handle and taſte to be <hi>Bread</hi> is <hi>Bread,</hi> and not the <hi>Body of a man;</hi> and what we ſee and taſte to be <hi>Wine</hi> is <hi>Wine,</hi> and not <hi>Bloud:</hi> And if this evidence may not paſs for ſufficient without any farther
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59936:155"/>proof, I do not ſee why any man, that hath confidence enough to do ſo, may not deny any thing to be what all the World ſees it is; or affirm any thing to be what all the World ſees it is not; and this without all poſſibility of being far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confuted. So that the buſineſs of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is not a controverſie of Scripture againſt Scripture, or of Reaſon againſt Reaſon, but of downright Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt the plain meaning of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and all the Senſe and Reaſon of Mankind.</p>
            <p>It is a moſt Self-evident Falſhood; and there is no Doctrine or Propoſition in the World that is of it ſelf more evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, than <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently falſe: And yet if it were poſſible to be true, it would be the moſt ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd and pernicious truth in the World, becauſe it would ſuffer nothing elſe to be true; it is like the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Church, which will needs be the whole Chriſtian Church, and will allow no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Society of Chriſtians to be any part of it: So <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> if it be true at all, it is all truth, and nothing elſe is true; for it cannot be true unleſs our Senſes, and the Senſes of all mankind be deceived about their proper objects; and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:59936:156"/>if this he true and certain, then nothing elſe can be ſo; for if we be not certain of what we ſee, we can be certain of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>And yet notwithſtanding all this, there are a Company of men in the World ſo abandon'd and given up by God to the efficacy of deluſion as in good earneſt to believe this groſs and palpable Errour, and to impoſe the belief of it upon the Chriſtian World under no leſs penalties than of temporal death and eternal damnation. And therefore to undeceive, if poſſible, theſe deluded Souls, it will be neceſſary to examine the pretended grounds of ſo falſe a Doctrine, and to lay open the monſtrous abſurdity of it.</p>
            <p>And in the handling of this Argument, I ſhall proceed in this plain method.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I ſhall conſider the pretended grounds and reaſons of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for this Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I ſhall produce our <hi>Objections</hi> againſt <hi>it.</hi> And if I can ſhew that there is no to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable ground for it, and that there are invincible Objections againſt it, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is not onely in reaſon excuſed from believing this Doctrine, but hath great cauſe to believe the contrary.</p>
            <pb n="309" facs="tcp:59936:156"/>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> FIRST, I will conſider the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed grounds and reaſons of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for this Doctrine. Which muſt be one or more of theſe <hi>five.</hi> Either 1<hi rend="sup">ſt.</hi> The Authority of Scripture. Or 2<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> The perpetual belief of this Doctrine in the Chriſtian Church, as an evidence that they always underſtood and interpreted our Saviour's words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> in this ſenſe. Or 3<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> The Authority of the preſent Church to make and declare new Articles of Faith. Or 4<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> The abſolute neceſſity of ſuch a change as this in the Sacrament to the comfort and benefit of thoſe who receive this Sacrament. Or 5<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> To magnifie the power of the Prieſt in being able to work ſo great a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. They pretend for this Doctrine the Authority of Scripture in thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>This is my body.</hi> Now to ſhew the inſufficiency of this pretence, I ſhall endeavour to make good theſe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That there is no neceſſity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding thoſe words of our Saviour in the ſenſe of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. That, there is a great deal of reaſon, nay that it is very abſurd and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:59936:157"/>to underſtand them otherwiſe.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is no neceſſity to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe words of our Saviour in the ſenſe of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> If there be any, it muſt be from one of theſe two reaſons. Either becauſe there are no fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative expreſſions in Scripture, which I think no man ever yet ſaid: or elſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Sacrament admits of no figures; which would be very abſurd for any man to ſay, ſince it is of the very nature of a Sacrament to repreſent and exhibit ſome inviſible grace and benefit by an outward ſign and figure: And eſpecially ſince it cannot be denied, but that in the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this very Sacrament our Saviour uſeth figurative expreſſions, and ſeveral words which cannot be taken ſtrictly and literally. When he gave the Cup he ſaid, <hi>This Cup is the new Teſtament in my bloud, which is ſhed for you and for many for the remiſſion of Sins.</hi> Where firſt, the <hi>Cup</hi> is put for the <hi>Wine</hi> contained in the Cup; or elſe if the words be literally taken, ſo as to ſignifie a ſubſtantial change, it is not of the <hi>Wine,</hi> but of the <hi>Cup;</hi> and that, not into the <hi>bloud of Chriſt</hi> but into the <hi>new Teſtament</hi> or <hi>new Covenant</hi> in his bloud. Beſides, that his bloud is ſaid <hi>then</hi> to be ſhied, and his body to be broken, which
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59936:157"/>was not till his Paſſion, which followed the inſtitution and firſt celebration of this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>But that there is no neceſſity to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand our Saviour's words in the ſenſe of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> I will take the plain conceſſion of a great number of the moſt learned Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Controverſie.<note n="(a)" place="margin">de Euch. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>23.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If there be no neceſſity of underſtanding our Saviour's words in the ſenſe of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> I am ſure there is a great deal of reaſon to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them otherwiſe. Whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the like expreſſions in Scripture; as where our Saviour ſays he is <hi>the door,</hi> and <hi>the true Vine</hi> (which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would mightily have triumph'd in, had it been ſaid, <hi>this is my true body.</hi>) And ſo likewiſe where the Church is ſaid to be <hi>Chriſt's body;</hi> and the <hi>Rock which</hi> followed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to be <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>They drank of that Rock which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them,</hi> and <hi>that rock was Chriſt:</hi> All which and innumerable more like expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in Scripture every man underſtands in a figurative, and not in a ſtrictly lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and abſurd ſenſe. And it is very well known, that in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59936:159"/>things are commonly ſaid to be that which they do ſignifie and repreſent; and there is not in that Language a more proper and uſual way of expreſſing a thing to ſignifie ſo and ſo, than to ſay that it is ſo and ſo. Thus <hi>Joſeph</hi> expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> dream to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.26. Says, <hi>the ſeven good kine are ſeven years,</hi> and <hi>the ſeven good ears of corn are ſeven years,</hi> that is, they ſignified or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented ſeven years of plenty; and ſo <hi>Pharaoh</hi> underſtood him, and ſo would any man of ſenſe underſtand the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; nor do I believe that any ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, who had never heard of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi> being grounded upon theſe words of our Saviour, <hi>this is my body,</hi> would upon reading the inſtitution of the Sacrament in the Goſpel ever have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd any ſuch thing to be meant by our Saviour in thoſe words; but would have underſtood his meaning to have been <hi>this Bread</hi> ſignifies my <hi>Body,</hi> this <hi>Cup</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies my <hi>Bloud;</hi> and this which you ſee me now do, do ye hereafter for a <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> of me: But ſurely it would never have enter'd into any man's mind to have thought that our Saviour did literally hold himſelf in his hand, and give away himſelf from himſelf with his own hands.</p>
            <pb n="315" facs="tcp:59936:159"/>
            <p>Or whether we compare theſe words of our Saviour with the ancient Form of the Paſſover uſed by the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s time, as<note n="(n)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Dialog. cum</hi> Tryp. <hi>p.</hi> 297. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</hi> Pariſ. 1639.</note> 
               <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> tells us, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>this Paſſover is our Saviour and our refuge:</hi> not that they believed the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb to be ſubſtantially changed either into God their Saviour who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or into the <hi>Meſſias</hi> the Saviour whom they expected and who was ſignified by it: But this Lamb which they did eat did repreſent to them and put them in mind of that Salvation which God wrought for their Fathers in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when by the ſlaying of a Lamb and ſprinkling the bloud of it upon their doors their firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born were paſſed over and ſpared; and did likewiſe foreſhew the Salvation of the <hi>Meſſias, the Lamb of God that was to take away the Sins of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And nothing is more common in all Languages than to give the name of the thing ſignified to the Sign. As the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a Deed or Writing under hand and Seal is call'd a conveyance or making over of ſuch an Eſtate, and it is really ſo; not the delivery of mere wax and parchment, but the conveyance of a real
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:59936:160"/>Eſtate; as truly and really to all effects and purpoſes of Law, as if the very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial houſes and lands themſelves could be and were actually delivered into my hands: In like manner the names of the things themſelves made over to us in the new Covenant of the Goſpel between God and man, are given to the Signs or Seals of that Covenant. By <hi>Baptiſm</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are ſaid to be <hi>made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, Heb.</hi> 6.4. And by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lord's Supper we are ſaid to <hi>communicate</hi> or to be made partakers <hi>of the Body of Chriſt</hi> which was broken, and of his <hi>Bloud</hi> which was ſhed for us, that is, of the real benefits of his death and paſſion. And thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of this Sacrament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the bloud of Chriſt? the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> But ſtill it is bread, and he ſtill calls it ſo, v. 17. <hi>For we being many are one bread and one body; for we are partakers of that one bread.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> might, if they pleaſed, as well argue from hence that all Chriſtians are ſubſtantially changed firſt into Bread, and then into the natural Body of Chriſt by their participation of the Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:59936:160"/>they are ſaid thereby to be <hi>one bread and one body.</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle in the next <hi>Chapter,</hi> after he had ſpoken of the conſecration of the Elements ſtill calls them the <hi>Bread and the Cup,</hi> in three <hi>verſes</hi> together, <hi>As often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup,</hi> v. 26. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily,</hi> v. 27. <hi>But let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of this bread and drink of that cup,</hi> v. 28. And our Saviour himſelf when he had ſaid, <hi>this is my bloud of the new Teſtament,</hi> immediately adds,<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 26.29.</note> 
               <hi>but I ſay unto you, I will not henceforth drink of this fruit of the Vine, untill I drink it new with you in my Father's Kingdom,</hi> that is, not till after his reſurrection, which was the firſt ſtep of his exaltation into the Kingdom given him by his Father, when the Scripture tells us he did eat and drink with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. But that which I obſerve from our Saviour's words, is, that after the conſecration of the <hi>Cup</hi> and the delivering of it to his Diſciples to drink of it, he tells them that he would thenceforth drink no more of that fruit of the Vine, which he had now drank with them, till after his Reſurrection. From whence it is plain that it was the fruit of the Vine,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59936:161"/>real wine, which our Saviour drank of and communicated to his Diſciples in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if we conſider that he celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Sacrament before his Paſſion, it is impoſſible theſe words ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood literally of the natural body and bloud of Chriſt; becauſe it was <hi>his body broken</hi> and <hi>his bloud ſhed</hi> which he gave to his Diſciples, which if we underſtand literally of his natural body broken and his bloud ſhed, then theſe words, <hi>this is my body which is broken, and this is my bloud which is ſhed,</hi> could not be true, becauſe his Body was then whole and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken, and his bloud not then ſhed; nor could it be a <hi>propitiatory Sacrifice</hi> (as they affirm this Sacrament to be) unleſs they will ſay that propitiation was made before Chriſt ſuffer'd: And it is likewiſe impoſſible that the Diſciples ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe words literally, becauſe they not onely plainly ſaw that what he gave them was <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> but they ſaw likewiſe as plainly that it was not his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which was given, but his Body which gave that which was given; not his body <hi>broken</hi> and his bloud <hi>ſhed,</hi> becauſe they ſaw him alive at that very time and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held his body whole and unpierc'd; and
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59936:161"/>therefore they could not underſtand theſe words literally: If they did, can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the Diſciples, who upon all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſions were ſo full of queſtions and objections, ſhould make no difficulty of this matter? nor ſo much as ask our Saviour, <hi>how</hi> can theſe things be? that they ſhould not tell him, we ſee this to be Bread and that to be Wine, and we ſee thy Body to be diſtinct from both; we ſee thy Body not broken, and thy Bloud not ſhed.</p>
            <p>From all which it muſt needs be very evident, to any man that will impartially conſider things, how little reaſon there is to underſtand thoſe words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>this is my body,</hi> and <hi>this is my bloud,</hi> in the ſenſe of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> nay on the contrary, that there is very great reaſon and an evident neceſſity to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them otherwiſe. I proceed to ſhew,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2ly.</hi> That this Doctrine is not ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the <hi>perpetual belief of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church,</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> vainly pretends as an evidence that the Church did always underſtand and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret our Saviour's words in this ſenſe.</p>
            <p>To manifeſt the groundleſneſs of this pretence, I ſhall, 1. ſhew by plain teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the <hi>Fathers</hi> in ſeveral Ages, that
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59936:162"/>this Doctrine was not the belief of the ancient Chriſtian Church. 2. I ſhall ſhew the time and occaſion of its coming in, and by what degrees it grew up and was eſtabliſh'd in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. 3. I ſhall anſwer their great pretended De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration that this always was and muſt have been the conſtant belief of the Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall ſhew by plain Teſtimonies of the <hi>Fathers</hi> in ſeveral Ages, for above five hundred years after Chriſt, that this Doctrine was not the <hi>belief of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chriſtian Church.</hi> I deny not but that the <hi>Fathers</hi> do, and that with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, very much magnifie the wonderfull myſtery and efficacy of this Sacrament, and frequently ſpeak of a great Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural change made by the divine bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; which we alſo readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. They ſay indeed, that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Bread and Wine do by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine bleſſing become to us the Body and Bloud of Chriſt: But they likewiſe ſay that the names of the things ſignified are given to the Signs; that the Bread and Wine do ſtill remain in their proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſubſtance, and that they are turn'd into the ſubſtance of our Bodies; that the Body of Chriſt in the Sacrament
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59936:162"/>is not his natural Body, but the ſign and figure of it; not that Body which was crucified, nor that Bloud which was ſhed upon the Croſs; and that it is impious to underſtand the <hi>eating of the fleſh of the Son of man</hi> and <hi>drinking his bloud</hi> literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: all which are directly oppoſite to the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and utterly inconſiſtent with it. I will ſelect but ſome ſew Teſtimonies of many which I might bring to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I begin with <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who ſays expreſly, that<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who ſpeaking of this Sacrament ſays, that the <hi>bread which is from the earth receiving the divine invocation is now no longer common bread, but the Euchariſt</hi> (or Sacrament) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of two things, the one earthly, the other heavenly.</hi> He ſays it is no longer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bread, but after invocation or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration it becomes the Sacrament, that is, bread ſanctified, conſiſting of two things an earthly and a heavenly; the earthly
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59936:163"/>thing is bread, and the heavenly is the divine bleſſing which by the invocation or conſecration is added to it. And<note n="*" place="margin">

There is another remarkable Teſtimony of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> which though it be not now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in thoſe <hi>works</hi> of his which remain, yet hath been preſerv'd by<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. in</hi> 1 Pet. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> and it is this; when (ſays he) <hi>the Greeks had taken ſome Servants, of the Chriſtian Catechumeni</hi> (that is, ſuch as had not been admitted to the Sacrament) <hi>and afterwards urged them by violence to tell them ſome of the ſecrets of the Chriſtians, theſe Servants having nothing to ſay that might gratiſy thoſe who offered violence to them, except onely that they had heard from their Maſters that the divine Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was the bloud and body of Chriſt, they thinking that it was really bloud and fleſh, declar'd as much to thoſe that queſtioned
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:59936:163"/>them. The Greeks taking this as if it were really done by the Chriſtians, diſcovered it to others of the Greeks; who hereupon put</hi> Sanctus <hi>and</hi> Blandina <hi>to the torture to make them confeſs it. To whom</hi> Blandina <hi>boldly anſwered, How would they endure to do this, who by way of exerciſe</hi> (or abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence) <hi>do not eat that fleſh which may lawfully he eaten?</hi> By which it appears that this which they would have charg'd upon <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as if they had literally eaten the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt in the Sacrament, was a falſe accuſation which theſe Martyrs denied, ſaying they were ſo far from that that they for their part did not eat any fleſh at all.</p>
            <p>The next is <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who proves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Marcion</hi> the Heretique that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Saviour was not a mere phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſm and appearance, but a real Body, becauſe the Sacrament is a figure and image of his Body; and if there be an image of his body he muſt have a real body, otherwiſe the Sacrament would be an image of an image.

               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:59936:164"/>And arguing againſt the <hi>Scepticks</hi> who denied the certainty of ſenſe he uſeth this Argument: That if we queſtion our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes we may doubt whether our Bleſſed Saviour were not deceived in what he heard, and ſaw, and touched.<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de Anima, p. <hi>319.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Origen</hi> in his<note n="*" place="margin">

And afterwards he adds by way of explication, <hi>it is not the matter of the bread, but the word which is ſpoken over it, which profiteth him that worthily eateth the Lord; and this</hi> (he ſays) <hi>he had ſpoken concerning the typical and Symbolical body.</hi> So that the matter of bread remaineth in the Sacrament, and this <hi>Origen</hi> calls the <hi>typical and Symbolical</hi>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:59936:164"/>body of Chriſt; and it is not the natural body of Chriſt which is there eaten, for the food eaten in the Sacrament, as to that of it which is material, goeth into the belly and is caſt out into the draught. This Teſtimony is ſo very plain in the Cauſe that <hi>Sextus Senenſis</hi> ſuſpects this place of <hi>Origen</hi> was depraved by the Heretiques. <hi>Cardinal Perron</hi> is contented to allow it to be <hi>Origen</hi>'s, but rejects his teſtimony becauſe he was accuſed of Hereſie by ſome of the Fathers, and ſays he talks like a Heretique in this place.

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:59936:167"/>us to do good, it is not figurative; but if it ſeem to command any heinous wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or crime, or to forbid that which is profitable and beneficial to others, it is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative. For example, Except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man and drink his bloud, ye have no life in you: This ſeems to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a heinous wickedneſs and crime, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a figure; commanding us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate of the paſſion of our Lord, and with delight and advantage to lay up in our memory that his fleſh was crucified and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for us.</hi> So that, according to St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s beſt skill in interpreting Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the <hi>literal eating</hi> of the fleſh of Chriſt and drinking his bloud would have been a great impiety; and therefore the expreſſion is to be underſtood <hi>figuratively:</hi> not as Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> would have it, onely in oppoſition to the eating of his fleſh and bloud in the groſs appearance of fleſh and bloud, but to the real eating of his natural body and bloud under any appearance whatſoever: For St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth not ſay, this is a Figurative ſpeech wherein we are commanded really to feed upon the natural body and bloud of Chriſt under the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of bread and wine, as the <hi>Cardinal</hi> would underſtand him; for then the ſpeech would be literal
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:59936:167"/>and not figurative: But he ſays, this is a figurative ſpeech wherein we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Spiritually to feed upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his Paſſion.</p>
            <p>To theſe I will add but <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> Teſtimonies more in the <hi>two</hi> following Ages.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſhall be of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who ſpeaking of that.<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 49.11.</note> Prophecy of <hi>Jacob</hi> concerning our Saviour, <hi>he waſhed his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Wine and his clothes in the bloud of grapes,</hi> hath theſe words,<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Dialog.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>as we call the myſtical fruit of the Vine</hi> (that is, the Wine in the Sacrament) <hi>after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration the bloud of the Lord, ſo he (viz. Jacob) calls the bloud of the true Vine</hi> (viz. of Chriſt) <hi>the bloud of the grape:</hi> but the bloud of Chriſt is not liberally and properly but onely figuratively the bloud of the grape, in the ſame ſenſe as he is ſaid to be the true Vine; and therefore the Wine in the Sacrament after conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration is in like manner not literally and properly but figuratively the bloud of Chriſt. And he explains this afterwards, ſaying, that <hi>our Saviour changed the names, and gave to his Body the name of the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol or Sign, and to the Symbol or Sign the name of his Body; thus when he had call'd himſelf the Vine, he call'd the Symbol or
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:59936:168"/>Sign his bloud;</hi> ſo that in the ſame ſenſe that he call'd himſelf the Vine, he call'd the Wine, which is the Symbol of his his bloud, his bloud: <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>he would have thoſe who partake of the divine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries not to attend to the nature of the things which are ſeen, but by the change of names to believe the change which is made by grace; for he who call'd that which by nature is body wheat and bread, and again likewiſe call'd himſelf the Vine, he honour'd the Symbols with the name of his body and bloud: not changing nature but adding grace to nature.</hi> Where you ſee he ſyas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that when he call'd the <hi>Symbols</hi> or Elements of the Sacrament, viz. <hi>Bread and Wine</hi> his <hi>Body and Bloud,</hi> he made no change in the nature of the things, onely added grace to nature, that is, by the Divine grace and bleſſing he raiſed them to a Spiritual and Supernatural virtue and efficacy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is of the ſame <hi>Theodoret</hi> in his ſecond Dialogue between a <hi>Catholique,</hi> under the name of <hi>Orthodoxus,</hi> and an <hi>Heretique</hi> under the name of <hi>Eraniſtes;</hi> who maintaining that the Humanity of Chriſt was chang'd into the ſubſtance of the Divinity (which was the Hereſie of <hi>Eutychees</hi>) he illuſtrates the matter by
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:59936:168"/>this Similitude, <hi>As,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Symbols of the Lord's body and bloud are one thing before the invocation of the Prieſt, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the invocation are changed and become another thing; So the body of our Lord af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his aſcenſion is changed into the divine ſubſtance.</hi> But what ſays the Catholique <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> to this? why, he talks juſt like one of Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi>'s Heretiques, <hi>Thou art,</hi> ſays he, <hi>caught in thy own net: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the myſtical Symbols after conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do not paſs out of their own nature; for they remain in their former ſubſtance, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and appearance and may be ſeen and handled even as before.</hi> He does not onely deny the outward figure and appearance of the Symbols to be chang'd, but the nature and ſubſtance of them, even in the proper and ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word ſubſtance; and it was neceſſary ſo to do, otherwiſe he had not given a pertinent anſwer to the ſimilitude urg'd againſt him.</p>
            <p>The next is one of their own Popes, <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> who brings the ſame Inſtance againſt the <hi>Eutychians;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Biblioth. Patr. Tom.</note> ſurely, ſays he, <hi>the Sacraments which we receive of the body and bloud of our Lord are a divine thing, ſo that by them we are made partakers of a divine nature, and yet it ceaſeth not to be
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:59936:169"/>the ſubſtance or nature of Bread and Wine; and certainly the image and reſemblance of Chriſt's body and bloud are celebrated in the action of the myſteries,</hi> that is, in the Sacrament. To make this Inſtance of any force againſt the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> who held that the body of Chriſt upon his aſcenſion ceas'd and was chang'd into the ſubſtance of his Divinity, it was neceſſary to deny that there was any ſubſtantial change in the Sacrament of the bread and wine into the body and bloud of Chriſt. So that here is an infallible authority, one of their own Popes expreſly againſt <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt Teſtimony I ſhall produce is of <hi>Facundus</hi> an <hi>African</hi> Biſhop, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the 6th Century.

               <hi>Chriſt vouchſafed to receive the Sacrament of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption both when he was circumciſed and baptized: And the Sacrament of Adoption may be called adoption, as the Sacrament of bis body and bloud, which is in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated bread and cup, is by us called his body and bloud: not that the bread,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is properly his body and the cup his
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:59936:169"/>bloud, but becauſe they contain in them the myſteries of his body and bloud; hence alſo our Lord himſelf called the bleſſed bread and cup which he gave to his Diſciples his body and bloud.</hi> Can any man after this believe; that it was then, and had ever been, the univerſal and received Doctrine of the Chriſtian Church, that the bread and wine in the Sacrament are ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally changed into the proper and natural body and bloud of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>By theſe plain Teſtimonies which I have produced, and I might have brought a great many more to the ſame purpoſe, it is I think evident beyond all denial that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> hath not been <hi>the perpetual belief of the Chriſtian Church.</hi> And this likewiſe is acknowledged by many great and learned men of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church.</hi>

               <hi>Second</hi> place, give an account of the <hi>particular time and occaſion of the coming in of this Doctrine,</hi> and by what ſteps and degrees it grew up and was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into an <hi>Article</hi> of Faith in the <hi>Romiſh Church.</hi> The Doctrine of the <hi>corporal preſence of Chriſt</hi> was firſt ſtarted upon occaſion of the Diſpute about the <hi>Worſhip of Images,</hi> in oppoſition whereto the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> about the year DCCL
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:59936:170"/>did argue thus, That our Lord having left us no other image of himſelf but the Sacrament, in which the ſubſtance of bread is the image of his body, we ought to make no other image of our Lord. In anſwer to this Argument the ſecond <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Nice,</hi> in the year DCCLXXXVII did declare, that the Sacrament after Conſecration <hi>is not the image and antitype</hi> of Chriſt's body and bloud, but is <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> his body and bloud. So that the <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral preſence of the body of Chriſt in the Sacrament</hi> was firſt brought <hi>in to ſupport the ſtupid Worſhip of Images:</hi> And indeed it could never have come in upon a more proper occaſion, not have been applied to a fitter purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but take notice how well this agrees with<note n="*" place="margin">De Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that <hi>none of the Ancients who wrote of Hereſies, hath put this errour</hi> (viz of denying <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi>) <hi>in his Caralogue; nor did any of the Ancients diſpute againſt this errour for the firſt</hi> 600 <hi>years.</hi> Which is very true, becauſe there could be no occaſion then to diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who demed <hi>Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> ſince, as I have ſhewn, this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine was not in being unleſs among the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Heretiques, for the firſt 600
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:59936:171"/>years and more. But<note n="†" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> goes on and tells us, that the <hi>firſt who call'd in queſtion the truth of the body of the Lord in the Euchariſt were the ICONOMACHI</hi> (the oppoſers of Images) <hi>after the year</hi> DCC <hi>in the Council of Conſtantinople; for theſe ſaid there was one image of Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt himſelf,</hi> viz. <hi>the bread and wine in the Euchariſt, which repreſents the body and bloud of Chriſt: Wherefore from that time the Greek Writers often admoniſh us that the Euchariſt is not the figure or image of the body of the Lord, but his true body, as appears from the</hi> VII. <hi>Synod;</hi> which agrees moſt exactly with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which I have given of the firſt riſe of this Doctrine, which began with the <hi>corporal preſence of Chriſt</hi> in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and afterwards proceeded to <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as this was the firſt occaſion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing this <hi>Doctrine</hi> among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſo in the <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Church <hi>Paſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius Radbertus,</hi> firſt a <hi>Monk,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Corbey,</hi> was the firſt broacher of it in the year DCCCXVIII.</p>
            <p>And for this, beſides the Evidence of Hiſtory, we have the acknowledgment of <hi>two</hi> very Eminent Perſons in the Church of <hi>Rome, Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Sirmondus,</hi> who
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:59936:171"/>do in effect confeſs that this <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> was the firſt who wrote to purpoſe upon this Argument.<note n="*" place="margin">De Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Eccleſ.</note> 
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in theſe words, <hi>This Authour was the firſt who hath ſeriouſly and copiouſly written concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of Chriſt's body and bloud in the Euchariſt:</hi> And<note n="†" place="margin">In vita <hi>Paſchaſii.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Sirmondus</hi> in theſe, he ſo firſt explained the genuine ſenſe of the Catholique Church, that he opened the way to the reſt who afterwards in great numbers wrote upon the ſame Argument: But though <hi>Sirmondus</hi> is pleaſed to ſay that he onely firſt explain'd the ſenſe of the Catholique Church in this Point, yet it is very plain from the Records of that Age which are left to us, that this was the firſt time that this Doctrine was broached in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church; and it met with great oppoſition in that Age, as I ſhall have occaſion hereafter to ſhew. For <hi>Rabanus Maurus</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> about the year DCCCXLVII reciting the very words of <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> wherein he had deliver'd this Doctrine, hath this remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſage concerning the novelty of it;<note n="‖" place="margin">Epiſt. ad <hi>Heribal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</hi> c. <hi>33.</hi>

               <hi>Some,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of late, not having a right opinion concerning the Sacrament of the body and bloud of our Lord, have ſaid that this is the body and bloud of our Lord which was born of the Virgin Mary, and in
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:59936:172"/>which our Lord ſuffered upon the Croſs and roſe from the dead: which errour,</hi> ſays he, <hi>we have oppos'd with all our might.</hi> From whence it is plain, by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of one of the greateſt and moſt learned Biſhops of that Age, and of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent reputation for Piety, that what is now the very Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> concerning the Sacrament, was then eſteem'd an Errour broach'd by ſome particular Perſons, but was far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the generally receiv'd Doctrine of that Age. Can any one think it poſſible, that ſo eminent a Perſon in the Church both for piety and learning, could have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd this Doctrine as an Errour and a Novelty, had it been the general Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Chriſtian Church, not onely in that but in all former Ages; and no cenſure paſs'd upon him for that which is now <hi>the great burning Article,</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and eſteemed by them one of the greateſt and moſt pernicious Hereſies?</p>
            <p>Afterwards in the year MLIX, when <hi>Berengarius</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> had rais'd a freſh oppoſition againſt this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, he was compell'd to recant it by Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> and the <hi>Council at Rome,</hi> in theſe words,<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>About XX years after, in the year MLXXIX Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> began to be ſenſible of this abſurdity; and therefore in another <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> made <hi>Berengarius</hi> to recant in another <hi>Form,</hi> viz.<note n="*" place="margin">Waldenſ.

            <p>So that from the firſt ſtarting of this Doctrine in the <hi>ſecond Council of Nice</hi> in the year DCCLXXXVII, till the <hi>Council</hi> under <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> the VII<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> in the year MLXXIX, it was almoſt three hundred years that this Doctrine was conteſted, and before this miſhapen <hi>Monſter of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation could be lick'd</hi> into that Form in which it is now ſetled and eſtabliſh'd in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Here then is a plain account of the firſt riſe of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and of the ſeveral ſteps whereby it was advanced by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> into an <hi>Article of Faith.</hi> I come now in the</p>

               <hi>Third</hi> place, to anſwer the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Demonſtration</hi> of the <hi>impoſſibility that this Doctrine, if it had been new, ſhould ever have come in, in any Age, and been received in the Church; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it muſt of neceſſity have been the perpetual belief of the Church in all Ages:</hi> For if it had not always been the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church, whenever it had attempted firſt to come in there would have been a great ſtir and buſtle about it, and the whole Chriſtian World would have roſe up in oppoſition to it.

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> we do aſſign a punctual and very likely time of the firſt riſe of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, about the beginning of the <hi>ninth</hi> Age; though it did not take firm root nor was fully ſetled and eſtabliſh'd till towards the end of the <hi>eleventh.</hi> And this was the moſt likely time of all other, from the beginning of Chriſtianity, for ſo groſs an Error to appear; it being,

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I have ſhewn likewiſe that there was <hi>conſiderable oppoſition</hi> made to this <hi>Errour</hi> at its firſt coming in. The general Ignorance and groſs Superſtition of that Age rendered the generality of people more quiet and ſecure, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to receive any thing that came
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:59936:174"/>under a pretence of myſtery in Religion and of greater reverence and devotion to the Sacrament, and that ſeemed any way to countenance the worſhip of <hi>Images,</hi> for which at that time they were zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly concern'd. But notwithſtanding the ſecurity and paſſive temper of the People, the men moſt eminent for piety and learning in that Time made great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance againſt it. I have already named <hi>Rabanus</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd it as an Errour lately ſprung up and which had then gained but upon ſome few perſons. To whom I may add <hi>Heribaldus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auxerres</hi> in <hi>France, Io. Scotus, Erigena,</hi> and <hi>Ratramnus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known by the name of <hi>Bertram,</hi> who at the ſame time were employed by the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Bald</hi> to oppoſe this growing Errour, and wrote, learnedly againſt it. And theſe were the eminent men for learning in that time. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> will not be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied unleſs there were ſome ſtir and buſtle about it, <hi>Bertram</hi> in his <hi>Preface</hi> to his Book tells us, that they <hi>who according to their ſeveral opinions talked differently about the myſtery of Chriſt's body and bloud were divided by no ſmall Schiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="346" facs="tcp:59936:175"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though for a more clear and ſatisfactory anſwer to this pretended <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration</hi> I have been contented to untie this knot, yet I could without all theſe pains have cut it. For ſuppoſe this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine had ſilently come in and without oppoſition, ſo that we could not aſſign the particular time and occaſion of its firſt Riſe; yet if it be evident from the Records of former Ages, for above D. years together, that this was not the ancient belief of the Church; and plain alſo, that this Doctrine was afterwards received in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, though we could not tell how and when it came in, yet it would be the wildeſt and moſt extravagant thing in the world to ſet up a pretended Demonſtration of Reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt plain Experience and matter of Fact. This is juſt <hi>Zenoe</hi>'s Demonſtration of the impoſſibility of motion againſt <hi>Diogenes</hi> walking before his Eyes. For this is to undertake to prove that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to have been, which moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was. Juſt thus the <hi>Servants</hi> in the <hi>Parable</hi> might have demonſtrated that the <hi>tares</hi> were <hi>wheat,</hi> becauſe they were ſure none but good ſeed was ſown at firſt, and no man could give any account of the punctual time when any <hi>tares</hi> were
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:59936:175"/>ſown, or by whom; and if an Enemy had come to do it, he muſt needs have met with great reſiſtance and oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but no ſuch reſiſtance was made, and therefore there could be no <hi>tares</hi> in the <hi>field,</hi> but that which they call'd <hi>tares</hi> was certainly <hi>good wheat.</hi> At the ſame rate a man might demonſtrate that <hi>our King,</hi> his <hi>Majeſty of great Britain,</hi> is not return'd into <hi>England,</hi> nor reſtor'd to his Crown; becauſe there being ſo great and powerfull an Army poſſeſs'd of his Lands, and therefore obliged by intereſt to keep him out, it was impoſſible he ſhould ever come in without a great deal of fighting and bloudſhed: but there was no ſuch thing, therefore he is not return'd and reſtor'd to his Crown. And by the like kind of Demonſtration one might prove that the <hi>Turk</hi> did not invade <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> laſt year, and beſiege <hi>Vienna;</hi> becauſe if he had, the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> who had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Army in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> in a readineſs, would certainly have employed it againſt him; but Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> certainly knows no ſuch thing was done: And therefore according to his way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, the <hi>matter of fact,</hi> ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reported and believed, concerning
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59936:176"/>the <hi>Turks Invaſion of Chriſtendom</hi> and <hi>beſieging Vienna</hi> laſt year, was a perfect miſtake. But a man may demonſtrate till his head and heart ake, before he ſhall ever be able to prove that which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is, or was, never to have been. For of all ſorts of impoſſibles nothing is more evidently ſo, than to make that which hath been not to have been. All the reaſon in the world is too weak to cope with ſo tough and obſtinate a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. And I have often wonder'd how a man of Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi>'s great wit and ſharp Judgment could prevail with himſelf to engage in ſo bad and baffled a Cauſe; or could think to defend it with ſo <hi>wooden a Dagger</hi> as his <hi>Demonſtration</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> againſt certain <hi>Experience</hi> and <hi>matter of Fact:</hi> A thing if it be poſſible, of equal abſurdity with what he pretends to demonſtrate, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> it ſelf. I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> pretended Ground of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> and that is, <hi>The Infallible Authority of the preſent Church to make and declare new Articles of Faith.</hi> And this in truth is the ground into which the moſt of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men of their Church did heretofore, and many do ſtill reſolve their belief of
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:59936:176"/>this Doctrine: And, as I have already ſhewn, do plainly ſay that they ſee no ſufficient reaſon, either from <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Tradition,</hi> for the belief of it: And that they ſhould have believed the contrary had not the determination of the Church obliged them otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>But if this Doctrine be obtruded upon the world merely by virtue of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and the Declaration of the <hi>Council</hi> under Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> or of the <hi>Lateran Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. then it is a plain Innovation in the Chriſtian Doctrine, and a new Article of Faith impos'd upon the Chriſtian world. And if any Church hath this power, the Chriſtian Faith may be enlarged and changed as often as men pleaſe; and that which is no part of our Saviour's Doctrine, nay, any thing though never ſo abſurd and unreaſonable, may become an Article of Faith obliging all Chriſtians to the belief of it, whenever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall think fit to ſtamp her Authority upon it: which would make Chriſtianity a moſt uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and endleſs thing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> pretended ground of this Doctrine is, <hi>the neceſſity of ſuch a change as this in the Sacrament to the comfort and
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:59936:177"/>benefit of thoſe who receive it.</hi> But there is no colour for this, if the thing be rightly conſider'd: Becauſe the comfort and benefit of the Sacrament depends upon the bleſſing annexed to the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as <hi>Water</hi> in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> without any ſubſtantial change made in that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may by the Divine bleſſing accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the Inſtitution be effectual to the waſhing away of Sin, and Spiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; So there can no reaſon in the world be given why the Elements of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> may not, by the ſame Divide bleſſing accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying this Inſtitution, make the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receivers partakers of all the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual comfort and benefit deſigned to us thereby without any ſubſtantial change made in thoſe Elements, ſince our Lord hath told us, that <hi>verily the fleſh profiteth nothing.</hi> So that if we could do ſo odd and ſtrange a thing as to eat the very natural fleſh and drink the bloud of our Lord, I do not ſee of what greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage it would be to us than what we may have by partaking of the Symbols of his body and bloud as he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>in remembrance of him.</hi> For the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual efficacy of the Sacrament doth not depend upon the nature of the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59936:177"/>ſuppoſing we receive what our Lord appointed, and receive it with a right preparation and diſpoſition of mind, but upon the ſupernatural bleſſing that goes along with it, and makes it effectual to thoſe ſpiritual ends for which it was appointed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> and laſt pretended ground of this Doctrine is, <hi>to magnifie the power of the Prieſt in being able to work ſo great a Miracle.</hi> And this with great pride and pomp is often urg'd by them as a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent inſtance of the Divine wiſedom, to find out ſo admirable a way to raiſe the power and reverence of the Prieſt; that he ſhould be able every day, and as often as he pleaſes, by repeating a few words to work ſo miraculous a change, and (as they love moſt abſurdly and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly to ſpeak) <hi>to make God himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is to pretend to a power above that of God himſelf, for he did not, nor cannot make himſelf, nor do any thing that implies a contradiction, as <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> evidently does in their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>to make God.</hi> For to make that which already is, and to make that <hi>now</hi> which <hi>always</hi> was, is not onely vain and trifling if it could be done, but impoſſible becauſe it implies a contradiction.</p>
            <pb n="352" facs="tcp:59936:178"/>
            <p>And what if after all <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> if it were poſſible and actually wrought by the Prieſt, would yet be no Miracle? For there are two things neceſſary to a Miracle that there be a ſupernatural effect wrought, and that this effect be evident to ſenſe. So that though a ſupernatural effect be wrought, yet if it be not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to ſenſe it is to all the ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of a Miracle as if it were not; and can be no teſtimony or proof of any thing, becauſe it ſelf ſtands in need of another Miracle to give teſtimony to it and to prove that it was wrought. And neither in Scripture, nor in profane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, nor in common uſe of ſpeech, is any thing call'd a Miracle but what falls under the notice of our ſenſes: A <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> being nothing elſe but <hi>a ſupernatural effect evident to ſenſe,</hi> the great end and deſign whereof is to be a ſenſible proof and conviction to us of ſomething that we do not ſee.</p>
            <p>And for want of this Condition, <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi> if it were true, would be no Miracle. It would indeed be very <hi>ſupernatural,</hi> but for all that it would not be a <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Miracle:</hi> For a Sign or Miracle is always a thing ſenſible, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it could be no Sign. Now that
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:59936:178"/>ſuch a change as is pretended in <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> ſhould really be wrought, and yet there ſhould be no ſign and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it, is a thing very wonderfull, but, not to ſenſe; for our ſenſes perceive no change, the Bread and Wine in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all our ſenſes remaining juſt as they were before: And that a thing ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to all appearance juſt as it was, hath nothing at all of wonder in it: we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der indeed when we ſee a ſtrange thing done, but no man wonders when he ſees nothing done. So that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> if they will needs have it a Miracle, is ſuch a Miracle as any man may work that hath but the confidence to face men down that he works it, and the fortune to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: And though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may magnify their Prieſts upon account of this Miracle, which they ſay they can work every day and every hour, yet I cannot underſtand the reaſon of it; for when this great work (as they call it) is done, there is nothing more appears to be done than if there were no Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle: Now ſuch a Miracle as to all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is no Miracle I ſee no reaſon why a Proteſtant Miniſter, as well as a Popiſh Prieſt, may not work as often as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; or if he can but have the patience
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:59936:179"/>to let it alone, it will work it ſelf. For ſurely nothing in the world is eaſier than to let a thing be as it is, and by ſpeaking a few words over it to make it juſt what it was before. Every man, every day, may work ten thouſand ſuch Miracles.</p>
            <p>And thus I have diſpathc'd the <hi>Firſt</hi> part of my Diſcourſe, which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the pretended grounds and <hi>Reaſons</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for this Doctrine, and to ſhew the weakneſs and inſufficiency of them. I come in the</p>
            <p>SECOND place, to produce our <hi>Objections</hi> againſt it. Which will be of ſo much the greater force, becauſe I have already ſhewn this Doctrine to be deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all Divine warrant and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and of any other ſort of Ground ſufficient in reaſon to juſtify it. So that I do not now object againſt a Doctrine which hath a fair probability of Divine Revelation on its ſide, for that would weigh down all objections, which did not plainly overthrow the probability and credit of its Divine Revelation: But I object againſt a Doctrine by the mere will and Tyranny of men impos'd upon the belief of Chriſtians, without <hi>any</hi> evidence of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and againſt all
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:59936:179"/>the evidence of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Senſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Objection I ſhall reduce to theſe <hi>two</hi> Heads. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The infinite ſcandal of this Doctrine to the Chriſtian Religion. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> The monſtrous and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable abſurdity of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The infinite ſcandal of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to the Chriſtian Religion.</hi> And that upon theſe <hi>four</hi> accounts. 1. Of the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of this Doctrine. 2. The real bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſneſs of this Sacrament and Rite of our Religion upon ſuppoſition of the truth of this Doctrine. 3. Of the cruel and bloudy conſequences of it. 4. Of the danger of Idolatry; which they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly guilty of, if this Doctrine be not true.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Upon account of <hi>the ſtupidity of this Doctrine.</hi> I remember that <hi>Tully,</hi> who was a man of very good ſenſe, inſtanceth in the conceit of <hi>eating God</hi> as the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of madneſs, and ſo ſtupid an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion as he thought no man was ever guilty of.<note n="*" place="margin">De Nat. Deorum. l. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>When we call,</hi> ſays he,
<hi>the fruits of the earth Ceres, and wine Bacchus, we uſe but the common language; but do you think any man ſo mad as to believe that which he eats to be God?</hi> It ſeems he could not believe that ſo extravagant a folly had ever entred into the mind of man. It is a very ſevere ſaying of <hi>Averroes</hi> the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi>
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:59936:180"/>Philoſopher (who lived after this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was entertained among <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) and ought to make the Church or <hi>Rome</hi> bluſh,<note n="*" place="margin">Dionyſ. Carthuſ. <hi>in</hi> 4. <hi>diſt.</hi> 10. <hi>art.</hi>
1.</note> if ſhe can; <hi>I have travell'd,</hi> ſays he, <hi>over the world, and have found divers</hi> Sects; <hi>but ſo ſottiſh a</hi> Sect <hi>or Law I never found, as is the</hi> Sect <hi>of the</hi> Chriſtians; <hi>becauſe with their own teeth they devour their God whom they worſhip.</hi> It was great ſtupidity in the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſay, <hi>Come let us make us Gods;</hi> but it was civilly ſaid of them, <hi>Let us make us Gods that may go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us,</hi> in compariſon of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who ſay, <hi>Let us make a God that we may eat him.</hi> So that upon the whole matter I cannot but wonder that they ſhould chuſe thus to expoſe Faith to the contempt of all that are endued with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And to ſpeak the plain truth, the Chriſtian Religion was never ſo horribly expoſed to the ſcorn of Atheiſts and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, as it hath been by this moſt abſurd and ſenſeleſs Doctrine. But thus it was foretold that<note n="†" place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.10.</note> 
               <hi>the Man of Sin</hi> ſhould come <hi>with Power and Signs and Lying Miracles, and with all deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> with all the <hi>Legerdemain</hi> and <hi>jugling</hi> tricks of falſhood and impoſture; amongſt which this of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> which they call a <hi>Miracle,</hi> and we a <hi>Cheat,</hi> is
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:59936:180"/>one of the chief: And in all probability thoſe common <hi>jugling</hi> words of <hi>hocus pocus,</hi> are nothing elſe but a corruption of <hi>hoc eſt corpus,</hi> by way of ridiculous imitation of the Prieſts of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in their <hi>trick</hi> of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> Into ſuch contempt by this fooliſh Doctrine and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Miracle of theirs have they brought the moſt ſacred and venerable Myſtery of our Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is very ſcandalous likewiſe upon account of the real <hi>barbarouſneſs</hi> of this Sacrament and Rite of our Religion, upon ſuppoſition of the truth of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Literally to <hi>eat the fleſh of the Son of man and to drink his bloud,</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> as I have ſhewed before, declares to be a great <hi>Impiety.</hi> And the impiety and barbarouſneſs of the thing is not in truth extenuated, but onely the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it, by its being done under the <hi>Species of Bread and Wine:</hi> For the thing they acknowledge is really done, and they believe that they verily eat and drink the natural fleſh and bloud of Chriſt. And what can any man do more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily towards his Friend? How can he poſſibly uſe him more barbarouſly, than to feaſt upon his living fleſh and bloud? It is one of the greateſt wonders in the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:59936:181"/>world, that it ſhould ever enter into the minds of men to put upon our Saviour's words, ſo eaſily capable of a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient ſenſe, and ſo neceſſarily requiring it, a meaning ſo plainly contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Senſe, and even to Humanity it ſelf. Had the ancient Chriſtians owned any ſuch Doctrine, we ſhould have heard of it from the Adverſaries of our Religion in every page of their Writings; and they would have deſired no greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt the Chriſtians than to have been able to hit them in the teeth with their feaſting upon the natural fleſh and Bloud of their Lord, and their God, and their beſt Friend. What endleſs tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs would they have made upon this Subject? And with what confidence would they have ſet the cruelty uſed by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in their <hi>Sacrament,</hi> againſt their God <hi>Saturn</hi>'s eating his own Children, and all the cruel and bloudy Rites of their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? But that no ſuch thing was then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the <hi>Heathens</hi> to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> is to a wiſe man inſtead of a thouſand Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations that no ſuch Doctrine was then believed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is ſcandalous alſo upon account of the <hi>cruel and bloudy conſequences</hi> of this Doctrine; ſo contrary to the plain Laws
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:59936:181"/>of Chriſtianity, and to one great end and deſign of this Sacrament, which is to unite Chriſtians in the moſt perfect love and charity to one another: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this Doctrine hath been the occaſion of the moſt barbarous and bloudy Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies that ever were acted in the World. For this hath been in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the great <hi>burning Article:</hi> and as abſurd and unreaſonable as it is, more Chriſtians have been murthered for the denyal of it than perhaps for all the other Articles of their Religion. And I think it may generally paſs for a true obſervation that all Sects are commonly moſt hot and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for thoſe things for which there is leaſt Reaſon; for what men want of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for their opinions, they uſually ſupply and make up in Rage. And it was no more than needed to uſe this ſeverity upon this occaſion; for nothing but the cruel fear of death could in probability have driven ſo great a part of mankind into the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of ſo unreaſonable and ſenſeleſs a Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O bleſſed Saviour!</hi> I thou beſt Friend and greateſt lover of mankind, who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine thou didſt ever intend that men ſhould kill one another for not being able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve contrary to their ſenſes; for being
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:59936:182"/>unwilling to think, that thou ſhouldſt make one of the moſt horrid and barbarous things that can be imagin'd a main Duty and principal Myſtery of thy Religion; for not flattering the pride and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prieſt who ſays he can make God, and for not complying with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtupidity of the People who are made to believe that they can eat him?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Upon account of the danger of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;</hi> which they are certainly guilty of if this Doctrine be not true, and ſuch a change as they pretend be not made in the Sacrament; for if it be not, then they worſhip a Creature inſtead of the Creatour God bleſſed for ever. But ſuch a change I have ſhewn to be impoſſible; or if it could be, yet they can never be certain that it is, and conſequently are always in danger of Idolatry: and that they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be certain that ſuch a change is made, is evident; becauſe, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs determination of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> that depends upon the mind and <hi>intention of the Prieſt,</hi> which cannot certainly be known but by Revelation, which is not pretended in this caſe. And if they be miſtaken about this change, through the knavery or croſſneſs of the Prieſt who will not <hi>make God</hi> but when he thinks fit,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:59936:182"/>they muſt not think to excuſe themſelves from Idolatry becauſe they intended to worſhip God and not a Creature; for ſo the <hi>Perſians</hi> might be excus'd from Idolatry in worſhipping the <hi>Sun,</hi> becauſe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to worſhip God and not a Creature; and ſo indeed we may excuſe all the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry that ever was in the world, which is nothing elſe but a miſtake of the Deity, and upon that miſtake a worſhipping of ſomething as God which is not God.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Beſides the infinite ſcandal of this Doctrine upon the accounts I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>the monſtrous abſurdities</hi> of it make it inſupportable to any Religion. I am very well aſſur'd of the grounds of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in general, and of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in particular; and yet I cannot ſee that the foundations of any revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are ſtrong enough to bear the weight of ſo many and ſo great abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as this Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> would load it withall. And to make this evident, I ſhall not inſiſt upon thoſe groſs contradictions, of the ſame Body being in ſo many ſeveral places at once; of our Saviour's giving away himſelf with his own hands to every one of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and yet ſtill keeping himſelf to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:59936:183"/>and a thouſand more of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but to ſhew the abſurdity of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine I ſhall only ask theſe few Queſtions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether any man have, or ever had greater evidence of the truth of any Divine Revelation than any man hath of the falſhood of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation?</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity were hardly poſſible to men, if all men had the ſame evidence for the Chriſtian Religion which they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> that is, the clear and irreſiſtible evidence of ſenſe. He that can once be brought to contradict or deny his ſenſes, is at an end of certainty; for what can a man be certain of if he be not certain of what he ſees? In ſome circumſtances our ſenſes may deceive us, but no Faculty deceives us ſo little and ſo ſeldom: And when our ſenſes do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, even that errour is not to be corrected without the help of our ſenſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſing this Doctrine had been delivered in Scripture in the very ſame words that it is decreed in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> by what clearer evidence or ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Argument could any man prove to me that ſuch words were in the Bible than I can prove to him that bread and wine after conſecration are bread and wine ſtill? He could but appeal to my eyes to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:59936:183"/>prove ſuch words to be in the Bible, and with the ſame reaſon and juſtice might I appeal to ſeveral of his ſenſes to prove to him that the bread and wine after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration are bread and wine ſtill.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether it be reaſonable to imagine that God ſhould make that a part of the Chriſtian Religion which ſhakes the main external evidence and confirmation of the whole? I mean the Miracles which were wrought by our Saviour and his Apoſtles, the aſſurance whereof did at firſt depend upon the certainty of ſenſe. For if the ſenſes of thoſe who ſay they ſaw them were deceived, then there might be no Miracles wrought; and conſequently it may juſtly be doubted whether that kind of confirmation which God hath given to the Chriſtian Religion would be ſtrong enough to prove it, ſuppoſing <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> to be a part of it: Becauſe every man hath as great evidence that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is falſe, as he hath that the Chriſtian Religion is true. Suppoſe then <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> to be part of the Chriſtian Doctrine, it muſt have the ſame confirmation with the whole, and that is Miracles: But of all Doctrines in the world it is peculiarly incapable of being proved by a Miracle. For if a Miracle
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:59936:184"/>were wrought for the proof of it, the very ſame aſſurance which any man hath of the truth of the Miracle he hath of the falſhood of the Doctrine, that is, the clear evidence of his Senſes. For that there is a Miracle wrought to prove <hi>that what he ſees in the Sacrament is not bread but the body of Chriſt,</hi> there is onely the evidence of ſenſe; and there is the very ſame evidence to prove <hi>that what he ſees in the Sacrament is not the body of Chriſt but bread.</hi> So that here would ariſe a new Controverſie, whether a man ſhould rather believe his Senſes giving teſtimony againſt the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> or bearing witneſs to a Miracle wrought to confirm that Doctrine; there being the very ſame evidence againſt the truth of the Doctrine, which there is for the truth of the Miracle: And then the Argument for <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and the Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it would juſt ballance one another; and conſequently <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is not to be proved by a Miracle, becauſe that would be, <hi>to prove to a man by ſome thing that he ſees, that he doth not ſee what he ſees.</hi> And if there were no other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is no part of the Chriſtian Doctrine, this would be ſufficient, that what proves the one doth
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:59936:184"/>as much overthrow the other; and that Miracles which are certainly the beſt and higheſt external proof of Chriſtianity are the worſt proof in the world of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi> unleſs a man can renounce his ſenſes at the ſame time that he relies upon them. For a man cannot believe a Miracle without relying upon ſenſe, nor <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> without renouncing it. So that never were any two things ſo ill coupled together as the Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity and that of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they draw ſeveral ways, and are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſtrangle one another: For the main evidence of the Chriſtian Doctrine, which is Miracles, is reſolved into the certainty of ſenſe, but this evidence is clear and point-blank againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I would ask what we are to think of the Argument which our Saviour uſed to convince his Diſciples after his Reſurrection that his Body was really riſen, and that they were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by a Ghoſt or Apparition? Is it a neceſſary and concluſive Argument or not?<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 24.38, 39.</note> 
               <hi>And he ſaid unto them, why are ye trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled? and why do thoughts ariſe in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I my ſelf; for a Spirit hath not fleſh and bones, as ye ſee me have.</hi> But now if
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:59936:185"/>we ſuppoſe with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> to be true, and that he had inſtructed his Diſciples in it juſt before his death, ſtrange thoughts might juſtly have riſen in their hearts, and they might have ſaid to him; Lord, it is but a few days ago ſince thou didſt teach us not to believe our ſenſes, but directly contrary to what we ſaw, <hi>viz.</hi> that the bread which thou gaveſt us in the Sacrament, though we ſaw it and handled it and taſted it to be bread, yet was not bread, but thine own natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and now thou appealed to our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to prove that this is thy body which we now ſee. If ſeeing and handling be an unqueſtionable evidence that things are what they appear to our ſenſes, then we were deceived before in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if they be not, then we are not ſure now that this is thy body which we now ſee and handle, but it may be perhaps bread under the appearance of fleſh and bones; juſt as in the Sacrament, that which we ſaw and handled and taſted to be bread was thy fleſh and bones under the form and appearance of bread. Now upon this ſuppoſition it would have been a hard matter to have quieted the thoughts of the Diſciples: For if the Argument
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:59936:185"/>which our Saviour uſed did certainly prove to them that what they ſaw and handled was his body, his very natural fleſh and bones, becauſe they ſaw and handled them, (which it were impious to deny) it would as ſtrongly prove that what they ſaw and received before in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was not the natural body and bloud of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but real bread and wine: And conſequently, that according to our Saviour's arguing after his Reſurrection they had no reaſon to believe <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> before. For that very Argument by which our Saviour proves the reality of his body after his Reſurrection doth as ſtrongly prove the reality of bread and wine after Conſecration. But our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Argument was moſt: infallibly good and true, and therefore the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is undoubtedly falſe.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter I ſhall onely ſay this, that ſome other Points between us and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are managed with ſome kind of wit and ſubtilty, but this of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is carried out by mere dint of impudence and facing down of Mankind.</p>
            <p>And of this the more diſcerning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of that Church are of late grown ſo ſenſible that they would now be glad to
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:59936:186"/>be rid of this odious and ridiculous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. But the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath rivetted it ſo faſt into their Religion, and made it ſo neceſſary and eſſential a Point of their belief, that they cannot now part with it if they would; it is like a Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone hung about the neck of Popery which will ſink it at the laſt.</p>
            <p>And though ſome of their greateſt Wits, as Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> and of late Monſieur <hi>Arnauld,</hi> have undertaken the defence of it in great Volumes; yet it is an abſurdity of that monſtrous and maſſy weight, that no humane authority or wit are able to ſupport it: It will make the very Pillars of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s crack, and requires more Volumes to make it good than would fill the <hi>Vatican.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I would apply my ſelf to the poor deluded People of that Church, if they were either permitted by their Prieſts, or durſt venture without their leave, to look into their Religion and to examine the Doctrines of it. <hi>Conſider, and ſhew your ſelves men.</hi> Do not ſuffer your ſelves any longer to be led blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and by an implicit Faith in your Prieſts, into the belief of nonſenſe and contradiction. Think it enough and too much to let them rook you of your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:59936:186"/>for pretended Pardons and counterfeit Reliques, but let not the Authority of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prieſt or Church perſuade you out of your Senſes. Credulity is certainly a fault as well as Infidelity: and he who ſaid, <hi>bleſſed are they that have not ſeen and yet have believed,</hi> hath no where ſaid, <hi>bleſſed are they that have ſeen and yet have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi> much leſs, <hi>bleſſed are they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve directly contrary to what they ſee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude this Diſcourſe. By what hath been ſaid upon this Argument it will appear, with how little truth, and reaſon, and regard to the intereſt of our common Chriſtianity, it is ſo often ſaid by our Adverſaries, that there are as good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the belief of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> as of the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity:</hi> When they themſelves do acknowledge with us that the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is grounded upon the Scriptures, and that according to the interpretation of them by the conſent of the ancient Fathers: But their Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> I have plainly ſhewn to have no ſuch ground, and that this is acknowledged by very many learned men of their own Church. And this Doctrine of theirs being firſt plainly proved by us to be deſtitute of all Divine Warrant and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:59936:187"/>our Objections againſt it from the manifold contradictions of it to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Senſe are ſo many Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the falſhood of it. Againſt all which they have nothing to put in the oppoſite Scale but the Infallibility of their Church, for which there is even leſs colour of proof from Scripture than for <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> it ſelf. But ſo fond are they of their own Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Errours, that rather than the Dictates of their Church, how groundleſs and abſurd ſoever, ſhould be call'd in queſtion; rather than not have their will of us in impoſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us what they pleaſe, they will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw any Article of the Chriſtian Faith, and ſhake the very foundations of our common Religion: A clear evidence that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the true Mother, ſince ſhe can be ſo well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that Chriſtianity ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed rather than the Point in queſtion ſhould be decided againſt her.</p>

            <p>THeſe are the words of <hi>Joſhua;</hi> who, after he had brought the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> thorough many difficulties and
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:59936:188"/>hazards into the quiet poſſeſſion of the promiſed land, like a good Prince and Father of his Country was very ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, before his death, to lay the firmeſt foundation he could deviſe of the future happineſs and proſperity of that People in whoſe preſent ſettlement he had, by the bleſſing of God, been ſo ſuccesfull an inſtrument.</p>
            <p>And becauſe he knew no means ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to this end, as to confirm them in the Religion and Worſhip of the true God, who had by ſo remarkable and miraculous a Providence planted them in that good Land; he ſummons the people together, and repreſents to them all thoſe conſiderations that might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them and their poſterity for ever, to continue in the true Religion. He tells them what God had already done for them, and what he had promiſed to do more, if they would be faithfull to him: And on the other hand, what fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calamities he had threatned, and would certainly bring upon them, in caſe they ſhould tranſgreſs his Covenant, and go and ſerve other Gods. And after many Arguments to this purpoſe, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with this earneſt Exhortation at the 14th. <hi>verſe, Now therefore fear the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:59936:188"/>Lord, and ſerve him in ſincerity and in truth, and put away the Gods which your father ſerved on the other ſide of the flood, and in Egypt; and ſerve ye the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to give the greater weight and force to this Exhortation, he do's by a very eloquent kind of inſinuation as it were once more ſet them at liberty, and leave them to their own election: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of man to ſtick more ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly to that which is not violently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but is our own free and deliberate choice: <hi>And if it ſeem evil unto you to ſerve the Lord, chuſe you this day whom you will ſerve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which words offer to our conſideration theſe following Obſervations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is here ſuppoſed that a Nation muſt be of ſome Religion or other. Joſhua</hi> do's not put this to their choice, but takes it for granted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That though Religion be a matter of choice, yet it is neither a thing indifferent in it ſelf, nor to a good Governour, what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion his people are of. Joſhua</hi> do's not put it to them as if it were an indifferent matter whether they ſerved God or Idols; he had ſufficiently declared before which of theſe was to be preferred.</p>
            <pb n="374" facs="tcp:59936:189"/>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The true Religion may have ſeveral prejudices and objections againſt it: If it ſeem evil unto you to ſerve the Lord,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that upon ſome accounts, and to ſome perſons, it may appear ſo.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That the true Religion hath thoſe real advantages on its ſide, that it may ſafely be referr'd to any conſiderate mans choice.</hi> And this ſeems to be the true Reaſon why <hi>Joſhua</hi> refers it to them: Not that he thought the thing indifferent, but becauſe he was fully ſatisfied that the truth and goodneſs of the one above the other was ſo evident, that there was no danger that any prudent man ſhould make a wrong choice, <hi>If it ſeem evil unto you to ſerve the Lord, chuſe you this day whom you will ſerve;</hi> intimating, that the plain difference of the things in competition would direct them what to chuſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The Example of Princes and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours hath a very great influence upon the people in matters of Religion.</hi> This I collect from the Context: And <hi>Joſhua</hi> was ſenſible of it; and therefore though he firmly believed the true Religion to have thoſe advantages that would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly recommend it to every impartial mans judgment, yet knowing that the multitude are eaſily impoſed upon and led
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:59936:189"/>into error, he thought fit to encline and determine them by his own example, and by declaring his own peremptory reſolution in the caſe, <hi>Chuſe you this day whom you will ſerve; as for me, I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord.</hi> Laws are a good ſecurity to Religion; but the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Governours is a living Law, which ſecretly overrules the minds of men, and bends them to a compliance with it.</p>
            <q>
               <l>— Non ſic inflectere ſenſus</l>
               <l>Humanos edicta valent, ut vita Regentis.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The Lives and Actions of Princes have uſually a greater ſway upon the minds of the People than their Laws.</p>
            <p>All theſe Obſervations are I think very natural, and very conſiderable. I ſhall not be able to ſpeak to them all; but ſhall proceed ſo far as the time and your patience will give me leave.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>It is here ſuppoſed that a Nation muſt be of ſome Religion or other. Joſhua</hi> do's not put it to their choice, whether they would worſhip any Deity at all. That had been too wild and extravagant a ſuppoſition, and which it is likely in
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:59936:190"/>thoſe days had never entered into any mans mind. But he takes it for granted that all people will be of ſome Religion; and then offers it to their conſideration which they would pitch upon, <hi>Chuſe you this day whom you will ſerve, whether the Gods which your fathers ſerved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Religion is a thing to which men are not only formed by education and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, but, as <hi>Tully</hi> ſays, <hi>Quo omnes duce naturâ vehimur,</hi> It is that to which we are all carried by a natural inclination: which is the true Reaſon why ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or other hath ſo univerſally prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in all Ages and places of the world.</p>
            <p>The temporal felicity of men, and the ends of Government can very hardly, if at all, be attained without Religion. Take away this, and all Obligations of Conſcience ceaſe: and where there is no obligation of Conſcience, all ſecurity of Truth and Juſtice and mutual confidence among men is at an end. For why ſhould I repoſe confidence in that man, why ſhould I take his word, or believe his promiſe, or put any of my Intereſts and concernments into his power, who hath no other reſtraint upon him but that of humane Laws, and is at liberty in his own mind and principles to do whatever
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:59936:190"/>he judgeth to be expedient for his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, provided he can but do it without danger to himſelf? So that declared A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm and Infidelity doth juſtly bring men under a jealouſie and ſuſpition with all mankind: And every wiſe man hath reaſon to be upon his guard againſt thoſe, from whom he hath no cauſe to expect more juſtice and truth and equity in their dealings than he can compel them to by the mere dint and force of Laws. For by declaring themſelves free from all other obligations they give us fair warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what we are to expect at their hands, and how far we may truſt them. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the ſtrongeſt band of humane Society; and God ſo neceſſary to the welfare and happineſs of mankind, as it could not have been more, if we could ſuppoſe the Being of God himſelf to have been purpoſely deſigned and contrived for the benefit and advantage of men: So that very well may it be taken for granted, that a Nation muſt be of ſome Religion or other.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, <hi>Though Religion be a matter of our choice, yet it is neither a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in it ſelf, nor to a good Governour, what Religion his people are of.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:59936:191"/>the ſuppoſition of the Text, <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> doth not leave them at liberty whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will ſerve God or Idols; but by a very Rhetorical Scheme of Speech endeavours to engage them more firmly to the worſhip of the true God.</p>
            <p>To countenance and ſupport the true Religion, and to take care that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be inſtructed in it, and that none be permitted to debauch and ſeduce men from it, properly belongs to the Civil Magiſtrate. This power the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> always exerciſed, not only with allowance, but with great approbation and commendation from God himſelf. And the caſe is not altered ſince Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: The better the Religion is, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it deſerves the countenance and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Civil Authority. And this Power of the Civil Magiſtrate in matters of Religion was never called in queſtion, but by the <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> of theſe later times: And yet among theſe, every Father and Maſter of a Family claims this Power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Children and Servants, at the ſame time that they deny it to the Magiſtrate over his Subjects. But I would fain know where the difference lyes. Hath a Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Family more power over thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Government than the Magistrate
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:59936:191"/>hath? No man ever pretended it: Nay, ſo far is it from that, that the natural Authority of a Father may be, and often is, limited and reſtrained by the Laws of the Civil Magiſtrate. And why then may not a Magiſtrate exerciſe the ſame power over his Subjects in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which every Maſter challengeth to himſelf in his own Family, that is, to eſtabliſh the true worſhip of God in ſuch manner and with ſuch circumſtances as he thinks beſt, and to permit none to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front it, or to ſeduce from it thoſe that are under his care. And to prevent all miſunderſtandings in this matter, I do not hereby aſcribe any thing to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate that can poſſibly give him any pretence of right to reject God's true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or to declare what he pleaſes to be ſo, and what Books he pleaſes to be <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi> and the <hi>Word of God;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to make a falſe Religion ſo cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant by the ſtamp of his Authority, as to oblige his Subjects to the profeſſion of it: Becauſe he who acknowledgeth himſelf to derive all his Authority from God, can pretend to none againſt Him. But if a falſe Religion be eſtabliſhed by Law, the caſe here is the ſame as in all other Laws that are ſinfull in the matter of them,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:59936:192"/>but yet made by a lawfull Authority; in this caſe the Subject is not bound to profeſs a falſe Religion, but patiently to ſuffer for the conſtant profeſſion of the true.</p>
            <p>And to ſpeak freely in this matter, I cannot think (till I be better inform'd, which I am always ready to be) that any pretence of Conſcience warrants any man, that is not extraordinarily commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd as the Apoſtles and firſt Publiſhers of the Goſpel were, and cannot juſtifie that Commiſſion by Miracles as they did, to affront the eſtabliſh'd Religion of a Nation (though it be falſe) and openly to draw men off from the profeſſion of it in contempt of the Magiſtrate and the Law: All that perſons of a different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion can in ſuch a caſe reaſonably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, is to enjoy the private liberty and exerciſe of their own Conſcience and Religion; for which they ought to be very thankfull, and to forbear the open making of Proſelytes to their own Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (though they be never ſo ſure that they are in the right) till they have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an extraordinary Commiſſion from God to that purpoſe, or the Providence of God make way for it by the permiſſion or connivance of the Magiſtrate. Not but
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:59936:192"/>that every man hath a <hi>Right</hi> to publiſh and propagate the true Religion, and to declare it againſt a falſe one; but there is no <hi>Obligation</hi> upon any man to attempt this to no purpoſe, and when without a miracle it can have no other effect but the loſs of his own life: unleſs he have an immediate command and Commiſſion from God to this purpoſe, and be endued with a power of miracles, as a publick Seal and Teſtimony of that Commiſſion, which was the caſe of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who after they had received an immediate Commiſſion were not to enter upon the execution of it, but to <hi>ſtay at Jeruſalem, till they were endued with power from on high.</hi> In this caſe a man is to abide all hazards, and may reaſonably expect both extraordinary aſſiſtance and ſucceſs, as the Apoſtles had; and even a miraculous protection till his work be done; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, if he be call<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d to ſuffer Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, a ſupernatural ſupport under thoſe ſufferings.</p>
            <p>And that they are guilty however of groſs Hypocriſie who pretend a further obligation of Conſcience in this matter, I ſhall give this plain Demonſtration, which relies upon Conceſſions generally made on all hands, and by all Parties. No
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:59936:193"/>Proteſtant (that I know of) holds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to go and Preach up his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and make Converts in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy:</hi> Nor do either the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Miniſters or <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſts think themſelves bound in conſcience to Preach the Goſpel in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky,</hi> and to confute the <hi>Alcheran,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the <hi>Mahometans.</hi> And what is the Reaſon? becauſe of the ſeverity of the Inquiſition in <hi>Popiſh</hi> Countreys, and of the Laws in <hi>Turky.</hi> But doth the danger then alter the obligation of Conſcience? No certainly; but it makes men throw off the falſe pretence and diſguiſe of it: But where there is a real obligation of Conſcience, danger ſhould not deter men from their Duty, as it did not the Apoſtles: which ſhews their caſe to be different from ours, and that probably this matter was ſtated right at firſt. So that whatever is pretended this is certain, that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have in truth no more obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of conſcience to make Converts here in <hi>England</hi> than in <hi>Sueden</hi> or <hi>Turky;</hi> where it ſeems the evident danger of the attempt hath for theſe many years given them a perfect diſcharge from their duty in this particular.

               <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Fourth</hi> Obſervations toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. That <hi>though the true Religion may have ſeveral prejudices and objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, yet upon examination there will be found thoſe real advantages on its ſide, that it may ſafely be referred to any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate mans choice: If it ſeem evil unto you to ſerve the Lord, chuſe you this day whom you will ſerve. If it ſeem evil unto you,</hi> Intimating that to ſome perſons and upon ſome accounts it may appear ſo.

            <p>The true Religion hath always layen under ſome prejudices with partial and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate men; which commonly ſpring from one of theſe <hi>two</hi> Cauſes, either the <hi>Prepoſſeſſions of a contrary Religion,</hi> or the <hi>contrariety of the true Religion to the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inclinations and practices of men,</hi> which uſually lyes at the bottom of all preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt Religion.

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:59936:194"/>with the <hi>firſt,</hi> which is as much as I ſhall be able to compaſs at this time.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>The Prepoſſeſſions of a falſe Religion;</hi> which commonly pretends <hi>two</hi> advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges on its ſide, <hi>Antiquity</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> and is wont to object to the true Religion <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Singularity.</hi> And <hi>both</hi> theſe are intimated both before and after the Text: <hi>Put away the gods which your Father ſerved on the other ſide of the flood, and in Egypt: And chuſe you this day whom you will ſerve, whether the gods which your Fathers ſerved on the other ſide of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites in whoſe land ye dwell.</hi> Idolatry was the Religion of their Fathers, and had ſpread it ſelf over the greateſt and moſt ancient Nations of the world and the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for Learning and Arts, the <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and was the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Amorites</hi> and the Nations round about them. So that <hi>Joſhua</hi> repreſents the <hi>Heathen Religion</hi> with all its ſtrength and advantage, and do's not diſſemble its confident pretence to <hi>Antiquity</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality,</hi> whereby they would alſo inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate the <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Singularity</hi> of the worſhip of the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And it is very well worthy our obſervation, that one or both of theſe have always been
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:59936:194"/>the Exceptions of falſe Religions (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superſtition</hi>) againſt the true Religion. The ancient Idolaters of the World pretended their Religion to be <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>univerſal,</hi> that their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſerved theſe Gods, and that the worſhip of the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a plain Innovation upon the <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> of the world, and that the very firſt riſe and original of it was within the memory of their Fathers; and no doubt they were almoſt perpetually upon the <hi>Jews</hi> with that pert queſtion, <hi>Where was your Religion before Abraham?</hi> and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, that it was the Religion of a very ſmall part and corner of the world, confined within a little Territory: But the great Nations of the world, the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> famous for all kind of knowledge and wiſedom, and indeed all the Nations round about them, worſhipped other Gods: And therefore it was an intolerable arrogance and ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in them, to condemn their Fathers and all the world, to be of a Religion dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from all other Nations, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſeparate themſelves and make a <hi>Schiſm</hi> from the reſt of mankind.</p>
            <pb n="386" facs="tcp:59936:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>And when the Goſpel appeared in the world, which the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (to prevent the ſcandal of that word) calls <hi>the time of Reformation,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathen</hi> ſtill renewed the ſame Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt Chriſtianity. The <hi>Jews</hi> urged againſt it, not the ancient <hi>Scriptures</hi> and the true word of God, but that which they pretended to be of much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Authority, the <hi>unwritten</hi> Word, the ancient and conſtant <hi>Traditions</hi> of their Church; and branded this new Religion with the name of Hereſie, <hi>After the way</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that you call Hereſie, ſo worſhip I the God of my Fathers; belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all things that are written in the Law, and in the Prophets:</hi> By which we ſee, that they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were not the firſt who called it <hi>Hereſie</hi> to reject humane Traditions, and to make the Scriptures the Rule of Faith: This was done long before by their reverend Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, the <hi>Scribes</hi> and and <hi>Phariſees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they pretended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it both <hi>Antiquity</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality,</hi> the conſtant belief and practice of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and almoſt all Places of the World; <hi>Sequimur majores noſtros qui feliciter ſecuti ſunt ſuos,</hi> ſays <hi>Symmachus, We follow our
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:59936:195"/>Fore-fathers, who happily followed theirs;</hi> But you bring in a new Religion, never known nor heard of in the World before.</p>
            <p>And when the Chriſtian Religion was moſt miſerably depraved and corrupted, in that diſmal night of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance which overſpread theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> parts of the World about the <hi>Ninth</hi> and <hi>Tenth Centùries;</hi> and many pernicious Doctrines and Superſtitious Practices were introduced, to the wofull defacing of the Chriſtian Religion, and making it quite another thing from what our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had left it; and theſe Corruptions and Abuſes had continued for ſeveral A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: No ſooner was a <hi>Reformation</hi> attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> make the ſame outcry of <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Singularity:</hi> And though we have ſubſtantially anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it a thouſand times, yet we cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of them to forbear that threadbare Queſtion, <hi>Where was your Religion before Luther?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore apply my ſelf to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer theſe <hi>two</hi> Exceptions with all the brevity and clearneſs I can: And I doubt not to make it appear, that as to the point of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality</hi> (though that be no-wiſe neceſſary to juſtifie the truth of
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:59936:196"/>any Religion) ours is not inferior to theirs; if we take in the Chriſtians of all Ages, and of all parts of the World: And as to the point of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that our Faith and the Doctrines of our Religion have clearly the advantage of theirs; all <hi>our</hi> Faith being unqueſtionably ancient, <hi>theirs</hi> not ſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the Point of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality.</hi> Which they of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I know not for what reaſon, will needs make an inſeparable property and mark of the true Church. And they never ſlout at the Proteſtant Religion with ſo good a grace among the ignorant People, as when they are bragging of their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and deſpiſing poor Proteſtancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe embraced by ſo few. This <hi>peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Northern Hereſie</hi> (as of late they ſcornfully call it) entertained it ſeems only in this cold and cloudy Corner of the World, by a company of dull ſtupid People, that can neither penetrate into the proofs nor the poſſibility of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation;</hi> whereas to the more refined <hi>Southern</hi> Wits all theſe difficult and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Points are as clear as their Sun at Noon-day.</p>
            <p>But to ſpeak to the thing it ſelf. If
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:59936:196"/>Number be neceſſary to prove the truth and goodneſs of any Religion, <hi>ours</hi> upon enquiry will be found not ſo inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as our Adverſaries would make it. Thoſe of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Religion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the moſt exact calculations that have been made by learned men, being eſteemed not much unequal in number to thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> perſuaſion. But then if we take in the ancient Chriſtian Church, whoſe Faith was the ſame with ours; and other Chriſtian Churches at this day, which all together are vaſtly greater and more numerous than the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and which agree with us, ſeveral of them in very conſiderable Doctrines and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices in diſpute between us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all of them in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming that fundamental point of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and <hi>Summ of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calls it) I mean the <hi>Supremacy of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>over all Chriſtians and Churches in the World,</hi> then the Number on our ſide will be much greater than on theirs.</p>
            <p>But we will not ſtand upon this advantage with them. Suppoſe we were by much the ſewer. So hath the true Church of God often been, without
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:59936:197"/>any the leaſt prejudice to the truth of their Religion. What think we of the Church in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, which for ought we know was confined to one Family; and one ſmall Kingdom, that of <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> King of <hi>Salem?</hi> What think we of it in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, when it was confined to one People wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in a Wilderneſs? What of it in <hi>Elijah</hi>'s time, when beſides the <hi>two</hi> Tribes that worſhipped at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there were in the other <hi>ten</hi> but <hi>ſeven thouſand that had not bowed their knee to Baal?</hi> What in our Saviour's time, when the whole Chriſtian Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of twelve Apoſtles, and ſeventy Diſciples, and ſome few Followers beſide? How would <hi>Bellarmine</hi> have deſpiſed this little Flock, becauſe it wanted one or two of his goodlieſt marks of the true Church, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality</hi> and <hi>Splendor?</hi> And what think we of the Chriſtian Church in the height of <hi>Arianiſm</hi> and <hi>Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> when a great part of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> was over-run with theſe Errors, and the number of the <hi>Orthodox</hi> was inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in compariſon of the <hi>Hereticks?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what need I to urge theſe Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? As if the Truth of a Religion were
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:59936:197"/>to be eſtimated and carried by the <hi>major Vote;</hi> which as it can be an Argument to none but Fools, ſo I dare ſay no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and wiſe man ever made uſe of it for a ſolid proof of the truth and goodneſs of any Church or Religion. If multitude be an Argument that men are in the right, in vain then hath the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil:</hi> For if this Argument be of any force, the greater Number never go wrong.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the Point of <hi>Antiquity.</hi> This is not always a certain Mark of the true Religion. For ſurely there was a time when Chriſtianity began and was a new Profeſſion, and then both <hi>Judaiſm</hi> and <hi>Paganiſm</hi> had certainly the advantage of it in Point of Antiquity. But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Queſtion in this Caſe is, <hi>Which is the true Ancient Chriſtian Faith, that of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>or Ours?</hi> And to make this matter plain, it is to be conſidered, that a great part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith is the ſame with <hi>Ours;</hi> as, namely, the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Apoſtles <hi>Creed,</hi> as explained by the firſt four General Councils. And theſe make up our whole Faith, ſo far as concerns matters of meer and ſimple Belief, that are of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:59936:198"/>to Salvation. And in this Faith of Ours, there is nothing wanting that can be ſhewn in any ancient <hi>Creed</hi> of the Chriſtian Church. And thus far <hi>Our</hi> Faith, and <hi>theirs</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, are undoubtedly of equal Antiquity, that is, as ancient as Chriſtianity it ſelf.</p>
            <p>All the Question is, as to the matters in difference between us. The principal whereof are the twelve new Articles of the Creed of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the IV, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Sacrifice of the Maſs, Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi> the <hi>Communion in one kind only, Purgatory, &amp;c.</hi> not one of which is to be found in any ancient <hi>Creed</hi> or Confeſſion of Faith generally allowed in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church. The Antiquity of theſe we deny, and affirm them to be Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and have particularly proved them to be ſo, not only to the anſwering, but almoſt to the ſilencing of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>negative</hi> Articles of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, in oppoſition to the Errors and Corruptions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faith, theſe are by accident become a part of our Faith and Religion, occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their Errors; as the renouncing of the Doctrines of <hi>Arianiſm</hi> became
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:59936:198"/>part of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion, after the riſe of that Hereſie.</p>
            <p>So that the Caſe is plainly this; We believe and teach all that is contained in the <hi>Creeds</hi> of the ancient Chriſtian Church, and was by them eſteemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation: and this is <hi>Our</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But now the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath innovated in the Chriſtian Religion, and made ſeveral Additions to it; and greatly corrupted it both in the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and Practices of it: And theſe <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> and <hi>Corruptions</hi> are their Religion, as it is diſtinct from ours; and both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are <hi>Corruptions</hi> and <hi>Novelties</hi> we have rejected them: And our rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe is our Reformation: And our Reformation we grant (if this will do them any good) not to be ſo ancient as their Corruptions: All Reformation neceſſarily ſuppoſing Corruptions and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors to have been before it.</p>
            <p>And now we are at a little better lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to anſwer that captious Queſtion of theirs, <hi>Where was your Religion before Luther?</hi> Where-ever Chriſtianity was; in ſome places more pure, in others more corrupted: but eſpecially in theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> parts of Chriſtendom overgrown for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:59936:199"/>Ages with manifold Errors and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, which the Reformation hath happily cut off, and caſt away. So that though our <hi>Reformation</hi> was as late as <hi>Luther,</hi> our <hi>Religion</hi> is as ancient as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity it ſelf. For when the <hi>Additions</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath made to the <hi>ancient</hi> Chriſtian Faith, and their Innovations in practice are pared off, that which remains of <hi>their</hi> Religion is <hi>ours;</hi> and <hi>this</hi> they canot deny to be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tittle of it the ancient Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>And what other Anſwer than this could the <hi>Jews</hi> have given to the like Queſtion, if it had been put to them by the <hi>ancient Idolaters</hi> of the World, <hi>Where was your Religion before Abraham?</hi> but the very ſame in ſubſtance which we now give to the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> That for many Ages the Worſhip of the one true God had been corrupted, and the Worſhip of Idols had prevailed in a great part of the World: that <hi>Abraham</hi> was raiſed up by God to reform Religion, and to reduce the Worſhip of God to its firſt Inſtitution; in the doing whereof he neceſſarily ſeparated Himſelf and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily from the Communion of thoſe Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters. So that though the <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:59936:199"/>which <hi>Abraham</hi> began was new, yet his <hi>Religion</hi> was truly ancient; as old as that of <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Adam.</hi> Which is the ſame in ſubſtance that we ſay, and with the ſame and equal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>And if they will ſtill complain of the <hi>Newneſs</hi> of our <hi>Reformation,</hi> ſo do we too, and are heartily ſorry it began no ſooner; but however better late than never. Beſides, it ought to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that this Objection of <hi>Novelty</hi> lies againſt all Reformation whatſoever, though never ſo neceſſary, and though things be never ſo much amiſs: And it is in effect to ſay, that if things be once bad, they muſt never be better, but muſt always remain as they are; for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be better, without being reformed, and a Reformation muſt begin ſometime, and whenever it begins it is certainly new. So that if a real Reformation be made, the thing juſtifies it ſelf; and no Objection of <hi>Novelty</hi> ought to take place againſt that which upon all accounts was ſo fit and neceſſary to be done. And if they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would but ſpeak their mind out in this matter, they are not ſo much diſpleaſed at the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:59936:200"/>which we have made becauſe it is <hi>new,</hi> as becauſe it is a <hi>Reformation.</hi> It was the humour of <hi>Babylon</hi> of old (as the <hi>Prophet</hi> tells us) that ſhe <hi>woud not be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 51.9.</note> and this is ſtill the temper of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they <hi>hate to he refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;</hi> and rather than acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have been once in an Error, they will continue in it for ever. And this is that which at firſt made, and ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues the breach and <hi>Separation</hi> between us; of which we are no-wiſe guilty who have onely reformed what was amiſs, but they who obſtinately perſiſt in their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and will needs impoſe them upon us and will not let us be of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion unleſs we will ſay they are no Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. The other <hi>Prejudice</hi> againſt the true Religion is, <hi>the contrariety of it to the vicious inclinations and practices of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is too heavy a yoke, and lays too great a reſtraint upon humane Nature. And this is that which in truth lies at the bottom of all Objections againſt Religion, <hi>Men love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Argument will require a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:59936:200"/>by it ſelf, and therefore I ſhall not now enter upon it; onely crave your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience a little longer, whilſt I make ſome Reflections upon what hath been already delivered.</p>
            <p>You ſee what are the <hi>Exceptions</hi> which Idolatry and Superſtition have always made, and do at this day ſtill make, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the true Religion; and how ſlight and inſignificant they are.</p>
            <p>But do we then charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with Idolatry? Our Church moſt certainly does ſo, and hath always done it from the beginning of the Reformation; in her <hi>Homilies,</hi> and <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> and in the <hi>Writings</hi> of her beſt and ableſt <hi>Champions.</hi> And though I have, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially as I could, conſider'd what hath been ſaid on both ſides in this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy; yet I muſt confeſs I could never yet ſee any tolerable defence made by them againſt this heavy charge. And they themſelves acknowledge themſelves to be greatly under the ſuſpicion of it, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as <hi>Cardinal Perron</hi> and others do) that the Primitive Chriſtians for ſome Ages did neither worſhip Images, nor pray to Saints, for fear of being thought to approach too near the Heathen Idolatry: And which
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:59936:201"/>is yet more; divers of their moſt learned men do confeſs, that if Tranſubſtantiation be not true, they are as groſs Idolaters as any in the World. And I hope they do not expect it from us, that in comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them, and to acquit them from the charge of Idolatry, we ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently deny our ſenſes, and believe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation; and if we do not believe this, they grant we have Reaſon to charge them with Idolatry.</p>
            <p>But we own them to be a true Church; which they cannot be, if they be guilty of Idolatry: This they often urge us withall, and there ſeems at firſt ſight to be ſomething in it: And for that reaſon I ſhall endeavour to give ſo clear and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory an anſwer to it, as that we may never more be troubled with it.</p>
            <p>The truth is, we would fain hope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſtill retain the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, and profeſs to believe all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, that notwithſtanding their Corruptions they may ſtill retain the true Eſſence of a Church: as a man may be truly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a man, though he have the plague upon him; and for that reaſon be fit to be avoided by all that wiſh well to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:59936:201"/>But if this will not do, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help it.

            <p>And now to draw to a Concluſion.</p>
            <pb n="400" facs="tcp:59936:202"/>
            <p>
               <hi>If it ſeem evil unto you to ſerve the Lord,</hi> and to worſhip him only; to pray to him alone, and that only in the name and mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, as he hath given us Commandment; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is but one God, and one Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus. If it ſeem evil unto you,</hi> to have the liberty to ſerve God in a Language you can underſtand; and to have the free uſe of the Holy <hi>Scriptures, which are able to make men wiſe unto Salvation;</hi> and to have the Sacraments of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion entirely adminiſtred to us, as our Lord did inſtitute and appoint.</p>
            <p>And on the other hand, if it ſeem good to us, to put our necks once more under that yoke, which our Fathers were not able to bear: If it be really a Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a Prince to hold the Pope's Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup, and a Privilege to be depoſed by him at his pleaſure, and a courteſie to be kill'd at his command: If to pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Underſtanding, and to obey without Reaſon, and to believe againſt Senſe; if Ignorance, and implicit Faith, and an Inquiſition, be in good earneſt ſuch char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and deſirable things: Then wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Popery; which, wherever thou
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:59936:202"/>comeſt, doſt infallibly bring all theſe wonderfull Privileges and Bleſſings along with thee.</p>
            <p>But the Queſtion is not now about the <hi>choice,</hi> but the <hi>change</hi> of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after we have been ſo long ſettled in the quiet poſſeſſion and enjoyment of it. Men are very loth to change even a falſe Religion. <hi>Hath a Nation changed their Gods, which yet are no Gods?</hi> And ſurely there is much more reaſon why we ſhould be tenacious of the Truth, and hold faſt that which is good.</p>
            <p>We have the beſt Religion in the World, the very ſame which the <hi>Son of God</hi> revealed, which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> planted, and confirmed by Miracles, and which the <hi>noble Army of Martyrs</hi> ſealed with their Blood: And we have retrench'd from it all falſe Doctrines and ſuperſtitious Practices which have been added ſince. And I think we may without immodeſty ſay, That upon the plain ſquare of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon, of the Tradition and Practice of the firſt and beſt Ages of the Chriſtian Church, we have fully juſtified <hi>Our</hi> Religion; and made it evident to the World, that our Adverſaries are put to very hard ſhifts, and upon a perpetual diſadvantage in the defence of <hi>Theirs.</hi>

I do not mean in compariſon of our Adverſaries (for that, as bad as we are, I hope we are yet able to do) but in compariſon of the Rules of our holy <hi>Religion,</hi> from which we are infinitely ſwerv'd; which I would to God we all did ſeriouſly conſider and lay to heart: I ſay, in compariſon of the Rules of our Holy Religion, which <hi>teach us to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World, in expectation of the bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearance of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> To whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>THeſe words, as I have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the former Diſcourſe, are the laſt counſel and advice which <hi>Joſhua</hi> gave to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after he had ſafely conducted them into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And that he might more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually perſwade them to continue ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in the worſhip of the true God, by an eloquent kind of inſinuation he doth as it were once more ſet them at liberty and leave them to their own choice; <hi>If it ſeem evil unto you to ſerve the Lord, chuſe you this day whom you will ſerve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The plain ſenſe of which Words may be reſolved into this <hi>Propoſition,</hi> That notwithſtanding all the prejudices and objections againſt the true Religion, yet it hath thoſe real advantages on its ſide
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:59936:204"/>that it may ſafely be referred to any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial and conſiderate man's choice; <hi>If it ſeem evil unto you to ſerve the Lord;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that to ſome perſons, and upon ſome accounts, it may ſeem ſo; but when the matter is throughly examined, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and choice cannot be difficult, nor require any long deliberation, <hi>Chuſe you this day whom you will ſerve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The true Religion hath always layn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome prejudices with partial arid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate men, ariſing chiefly from theſe <hi>two</hi> Cauſes; the <hi>prepoſſeſſions of a falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> and <hi>the contrariety of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to the inclinations of men, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs of it in point of practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>From the prepoſſeſſions of a falſe Religion;</hi> which hath always been wont to lay claim to <hi>Antiquity</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality,</hi> and to charge the true Religion with <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty</hi> and <hi>Singularity.</hi> And both theſe are intimated before the Text; <hi>Put away the Gods whom your Fathers ſerved, on the other ſide of the Flood and in Egypt, and chuſe you this day whom you will ſerve.</hi> It was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the worſhip of Idols was the ancient Religion of the world, of thoſe great Nations, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and of all the Nations round about them. But this hath already been conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at large.</p>
            <pb n="405" facs="tcp:59936:204"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are another ſort of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt Religion, more apt to ſtick with men of better ſenſe and reaſon; and theſe ariſe principally from <hi>the contrariety of the true Religion to the inclinations of men, and the uneaſineſs of it in point of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</hi> It is pretended that Religion is a heavy yoke, and lays too great a reſtraint upon humane Nature, and that the Laws of it bear too hard upon the general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of mankind.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not at preſent meddle with the ſpeculative Objections againſt Religion, upon account of the pretended unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs of many things in point of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: becauſe the contrariety of the true Religion to the inclinations of men, and the uneaſineſs of it in point of practice, is that which in truth lies at the bottom of Atheiſm and Inſidelity, and raiſes all that animoſity which is in the minds of bad men againſt Religion, and exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates them to oppoſe it with all their wit and malice: <hi>Men love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi> And if this prejudice were but once removed, and men were in ſome meaſure reconciled to the practice of Religion, the ſpeculative Objections againſt it would almoſt vaniſh of themſelves: for there wants little elſe
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:59936:205"/>to enable a man to anſwer them, but a willingneſs of mind to have them anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that we have no intereſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to the contrary. And therefore I ſhall at preſent wholly apply my ſelf to remove this prejudice againſt Religion, from <hi>the contrariety of it to the inclinations of men,</hi> and <hi>the uneaſineſs of it in point of practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there are two parts of this Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1ſt. That a great part of the Laws of Religion do thwart the natural inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, which may reaſonably be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be from God. And,</item>
               <item>2ly. That all of them together are a heavy yoke, and do lay too great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon humane Nature, intrenching too much upon the pleaſures and liberty of it.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>That a great part of the Laws of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion do thwart the natural inclinations of men, which may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to be from God.</hi> So that God ſeems to have ſet our nature and our duty at variance, to have given us appetites and inclinations one way, and Laws another: which if it were true muſt needs render the practice of Religion very grievous and uneaſie.</p>
            <pb n="407" facs="tcp:59936:205"/>
            <p>The force of this Objection is very ſmartly expreſſed in thoſe celebrated Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of a Noble <hi>Poet</hi> of our own, which are ſo frequently in the mouths of many who are thought to bear no good will to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <q>
               <l>O weariſome condition of Humanity,</l>
               <l>Born under one Law, to another bound;</l>
               <l>Vainly begot, and yet forbidden Vanity;</l>
               <l>Created ſick, commanded to be ſound.</l>
               <l>If Nature did not take delight in blood,</l>
               <l>She would have made more eaſie ways to good.</l>
            </q>
            <p>So that this Objection would ſain charge the ſins of men upon God; firſt upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the evil inclinations of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and then of the contrariety of our duty to thoſe inclinations. And from the beginning man hath always been apt to lay the blame of his faults where it can leaſt lye, upon goodneſs and perfection it ſelf. The very firſt ſin that ever man was guilty of he endeavoured to throw upon God: <hi>The woman whom thou gaveſt me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Adam</hi>) <hi>ſhe gave me of the tree, and I did eat:</hi> And his poſterity are ſtill apt to excuſe themſelves the ſame way. But to return a particular anſwer to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <pb n="408" facs="tcp:59936:206"/>
            <p n="1">1. We will acknowledge ſo much of it as is true; That there is a great dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy and corruption of humane Nature, from what it was originally framed when it came out of God's hands: of which the Scripture gives us this account, that it was occaſioned by the voluntary tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of a plain and eaſy Command given by God to our firſt Parents. And this weakneſs contracted by the fall of our firſt. Parents naturally deſcends upon us their Poſterity, and viſibly diſcovers it ſelf in our inclinations to evil, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence to that which is good.</p>
            <p>And of this the heathen Philoſophers, from the light of nature, and their own experience and obſervation of themſelves and others, were very ſenſible; that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature was very much declined from its primitive rectitude, and ſunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a weak and drooping and ſickly State which they called a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the moulting of the wings of the ſoul: But yet they were ſo juſt and reaſonable as not to charge this upon God, but upon ſome corruption and impurity contracted by the Soul in a former State, before its union with the Body. For the deſcent of the Soul into theſe groſs earthly Bodies they looked upon as partly the puniſhment
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:59936:206"/>of faults committed in a former State, and partly as the opportunity of a new tryal in order to its purgation and recovery. And this was the beſt account they were able to give of this matter, without the Light of Divine Revelation.</p>
            <p>So that the degeneracy of humane Nature is univerſally acknowledged, and God acquitted from being the cauſe of it: But however, the poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> do all partake of the weakneſs contracted by his fall, and do ſtill labour under the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and inconveniences of it. But then this degeneracy is not total. For though our faculties be much weakned and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, yet they are not deſtroyed nor wholly perverted. Our natural Judgment and Conſcience doth ſtill direct to us what is good, and what we ought to do; and the impreſſions of the natural Law, as to the great lines of our duty, are ſtill legible upon our hearts. So that the Law written in God's Word is not contrary to the Law written upon our hearts. And therefore it is not truly ſaid, <hi>that we are born under one Law and bound to another.</hi> But the great diſorder is, that our inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour faculties, our ſenſitive appetite and paſſions, are broke looſe and have got head
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:59936:207"/>of our Reaſon, and are upon all occaſions apt to rebel I againſt it: but our Judgment ſtill dictates the very ſame things which the Law of God doth enjoyn.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe very viſible, that the ſad effects of this degeneracy do not appear equally and alike in all: whether from the better or worſe temper of our Bodies or from ſome other more ſecret cauſe, I ſhall not determine, becauſe I know not: But that there is a difference is evident. for though a proneneſs to evil, and ſome ſeeds of it be in all, yet we may plainly diſcover in many very early and forward inclinations to ſome kinds of vertue and goodneſs; which being cultivated by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, may under the ordinary influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God's grace be carried on with great caſe to great perfection.</p>
            <p>And there are others who are not ſo ſtrongly bent to that which is evil, but that by good inſtruction and example in their tender years they may be ſwayed the other way, and without great difficulty formed to goodneſs.</p>
            <p>There are ſome indeed (which is the hardeſt caſe) in whom there do very early appear ſtrong propenſions and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to evil, eſpecially to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular kinds of vice: But the caſe of theſe
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:59936:207"/>is not deſperate; though greater attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and care, and a much more prudent management is required in the education of ſuch perſons to correct their evil tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and by degrees to bend their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations the right way? and if the ſeeds of piety and vertue be but carefully ſown at firſt, very much may be done by this means, even in the moſt depraved Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, towards the altering and changing of them; however, to the checking and controuling of their vicious inclinations. And if theſe perſons, when they come to riper years, would purſue theſe advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of education, and take ſome pains with themſelves, and earneſtly ſeek the aſſiſtance of God's grace, I doubt not but even theſe perſons by degrees might at laſt get the maſtery of their unhappy tempers.</p>
            <p>For next to the Being and perfections of God, and the immortality of our own Souls, there is no Principle of Religion that I do more firmly believe than this, that God hath that love for men that if we do heartily beg his aſſiſtance, and be not wanting to our ſelves, he will afford it to every one of us in proportion to our need of it; that he is always before hand with us, and prevents every man with the gracious offers of his help. And I doubt
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:59936:208"/>not but many very perverſe Natures have thus been reclaimed. For God, who is the <hi>Lover of Souls</hi> (as the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> calls him) though he may put ſome men under more difficult circumſtances of becoming good than others, yet he leaves no man under a fatal neceſſity of being wicked and periſhing everlaſtingly. He tenderly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders every man's caſe and circumſtances, and it is we that pull deſtruction upon our ſelves, with the works of our own hands: But as ſure as God is good and juſt, no man in the world is ruined for want of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſufficient help and aid afforded to him by God for his recovery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is likewiſe to be conſidered that God did not deſign to create man in the full poſſeſſion of happineſs at firſt, but to train him up to it by the tryal of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. But there could be no tryal of our obedience without ſome difficulty in our duty: Either by reaſon of powerfull temptations from without, or of croſs and perverſe inclinations from within.</p>
            <p>Our firſt Parents, in their ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, had only the tryal of temptation without; to which they yielded, and were overcome; having only a natural power to have reſiſted the temptation, without any aid of ſupernatural grace:
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:59936:208"/>And that weakneſs to good, and proneneſs to evil, which they by wilfull tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion contracted, is naturally derived to us; and we neceſſarily partake of the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs and impurity of the Fountain from whence we ſpring. So that we now la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under a double difficulty; being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by temptations from without, and incited by evil inclinations from within: But then, to balance theſe, we have a double advantage; that a greater reward is propoſed to us, than for ought we know would have been conferred on our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had they continued innocent; and that we are endued with a ſupernatural power to conflict with theſe difficulties. So that, according to the mercifull diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of God, all this conflict between our inclination and our duty does only ſerve to give a fairer opportunity for the fitting tryal of our obedience, and for the more glorious reward of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God hath provided an univerſal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for this degeneracy and weakneſs of humane Nature: So that what we loſt by the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> is abundantly repaired to us by the ſecond. This St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. that <hi>as by one man ſin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the world, and death by ſin; ſo the Grace of God hath abounded to all men by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:59936:209"/>Chriſt:</hi> And that to ſuch a degree, as effectually to countervall the ill effects of original ſin, and really to enable men, if they be not wanting to themſelves, to maſter and ſubdue all the bad inclinations of nature, even in thoſe who ſeem to be naturally moſt corrupt and depraved.</p>
            <p>And if this be true, we may without any reflexion upon God acknowledge, that though he did not at firſt <hi>create</hi> man <hi>ſick</hi> and <hi>weak,</hi> yet he having made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo, his poſterity are born ſo: But then God hath not left us helpleſs in this weak and miſerable State, into which by wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tranſgreſſion mankind is fallen: But as he commands us to be <hi>ſound,</hi> ſo he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us ſufficient aids of his grace by Jeſus Chriſt for our recovery.</p>
            <p>And though <hi>there is a Law in our Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers warring againſt the Law of our Minds, and captivating us to the Law of Sin and Death; i. e.</hi> though our ſenſitive appetite and paſſions are apt to rebell againſt the reaſon of our minds and the dictates of our natural Concience, yet every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an may ſay with St. <hi>Paul, thanks be to God, who hath given its the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> i. e. hath not left us deſtitute of a ſufficient aid and ſtrength to enable us to conquer the rebellious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:59936:209"/>of ſin, by the powerfull aſſiſtance of that grace which is ſo plentifully offered to us in the Goſpel. And this is the caſe of all thoſe who live under the Goſpel: As for others, as their caſe is beſt known to God, ſo we have no reaſon to doubt but that his infinite goodneſs and mercy takes that care of them which becomes <hi>a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Creatour:</hi> Though both the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and the methods of his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them are Secret and unknown to us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The hardeſt conteſt between man's inclination and duty, is in thoſe who have wilfully contracted vicious habits, and by that means, rendred their duty much more difficult to themſelves; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving greatly improved the evil inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of nature by wicked practice and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom. For the <hi>Scripture</hi> plainly ſuppoſeth, that men may debauch even corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and make themſelves ten fold more the Children of wrath and of the Devil than they were by Nature.</p>
            <p>This is a caſe ſadly to be deplored, but yet not utterly to be deſpaired of. And therefore thoſe who by a long progreſs in an evil courſe, are plunged into this ſad condition, ought to conſider that they are not to be reſcued out of it by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary reſolution, and a common grace of
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:59936:210"/>God. Their caſe plainly requires an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary remedy. For he that is deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged in vice is like a man laid faſt in a bogg, who by a faint and lazy ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling to get out, does but ſpend his ſtrength to no purpoſe, and ſinks himſelf the deeper into it: The only way is, by a reſolute and vigorous effort to ſpring out, if poſſible, at once. And therefore in this caſe, to a vigorous reſolution there muſt be joyned an earneſt application to God for his powerfull grace and aſſiſtance, to help us out of this miſerable State. And if we be truly ſenſible of the deſperate danger of our condition, the preſſing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of our caſe will be apt to inſpire us with a mighty reſolution. For <hi>power and neceſſity are neighbours,</hi> and never dwell far aſunder. When men are ſorely urged and preſſed, they find a power in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves which they thought they had not. Like a coward driven up to a wall, who in the extremity of diſtreſs and deſpair will fight terribly and perform wonders: or like a man lame of the Gout, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſaulted by a preſent and terrible dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger forgets his Diſeaſe, and will find his legs rather than loſe his life.</p>
            <p>And in this, I do not ſpeak above the rate of humane Nature, and what men
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:59936:210"/>throughly rouſed and awakened to a ſenſe of their danger, by a mighty reſolution may morally do, through that Divine grace and aſſiſtance which is ever ready to be afforded to well reſolved minds, and ſuch as are ſincerely bent to return to God and their Duty. More than this I cannot ſay for the encouragement of thoſe who have proceeded far in an evil courſe: And they who have made their caſe ſo very deſperate, ought to be very thankfull to God that there is any remedy left for them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. From all that hath been ſaid, it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appears, how malicious a ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is, that God ſeeks the deſtruction of men, and hath made his Laws on purpoſe ſo difficult and croſs to our inclinations that he might have an advantage to ruine us for our diſobedience to them. Alas, we are ſo abſolutely under the Power of God, and ſo unable to withſtand it, that he may deſtroy us when he pleaſeth, without ſeeking pretences for it: <hi>For who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> If goodneſs were not his nature, he hath power enough to bear out whatever he hath a mind to do to us. But our deſtruction is plainly of our ſelves, and God is free from the bloud of all men. And he hath not made the way to Eternal
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:59936:211"/>Life ſo difficult to any of us, with a deſign to make us miſerable, but that we by a vigorous reſolution, and an unwearied dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and a patient continuance in well doing, might win and wear a more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Crown, and be fit to receive a more ample reward from his bounty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: yea, in ſome ſenſe, I may ſay, from his juſtice; <hi>For God is not unrighteous, to forget our work and labour and love.</hi> He will fully conſider all the pains that any of us take in his ſervice, and all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that we ſtruggle with out of love to God and claſhing of our duty with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, is I hope fully anſwered: Since God hath provided ſo powerfull and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual a remedy againſt our natural impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and infirmity, by the Grace of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And though to thoſe who have wilfully contracted vicious habits a religious and vertuous courſe of life be very difficult, yet the main difficulty lyes in our firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon it; And when that is over, the ways of goodneſs are as eaſy as it is ſit any thing ſhould be that is ſo excellent, and that hath the encouragement of ſo glorious a reward. Cuſtome will recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile men almoſt to any thing: but there
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:59936:211"/>are thoſe charms in the ways of wiſedom and vertue, that a little acquaintance and converſation with them will ſoon make them more delightfull than any other courſe. And who would grudge any pains and trouble to bring himſelf into ſo ſafe and happy a condition: After we have tryed both courſes, of Religion and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs, of Vertue and Vice, we ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find, that nothing is ſo wiſe, ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and ſo comfortable as to be vertuous we are inwardly convinced we ought to do. Nor would I deſire more of any man in this matter, than to follow the ſobereſt convictions of his own mind, and to do that which upon the moſt ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration at all times, in proſperity and affliction, in ſickneſs and health, in the time of life and at the hour of death, he judgeth wiſeſt and ſafeſt for him to do. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Branch of the Objection; <hi>that the Laws of Religion</hi> (and particularly of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi>) <hi>are a heavy yoke, laying too great a reſtraint upon humane nature, and entrenching too much upon the pleaſures and liberty of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="420" facs="tcp:59936:212"/>
            <p>There was, I confeſs, ſome pretence for this Objection againſt the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; which by the multitude of its po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Inſtitutions and external obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces muſt needs have been very burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. And the ſame Objection lyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who (as they have handled Chriſtianity) by the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable number of their needleſs and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Ceremonies, have made the yoke of <hi>Chriſt</hi> heavier than that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> a more carnal Commandment than the <hi>Law.</hi> So that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is loſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them in the trappings and accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trements of it: with which inſtead of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning Religion they have ſtrangely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed it, and quite ſtifled it in the crowd of external Rites and Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>But the pure Chriſtian Religion, as it was delivered by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> hath hardly any thing in it that is poſitive; except the two Sacraments, which are not very troubleſome neither, but very much for our comfort and advantage, becauſe they convey and confirm to us the great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and privileges of our Religion. In other things, Chriſtianity hath hardly impoſed any other Laws upon us but what are enacted in our Natures, or are agreeable to the prime and fundamental
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:59936:212"/>Laws of it: nothing but what every man's reaſon either dictates to him to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or approves as highly fit and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>But we do moſt groſly miſtake the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of pleaſure and liberty, if we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe them to our ſelves in any evil and wicked courſe. For, upon due ſearch and tryal it will be found, that true plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and perfect freedom, are no where to be found but in the practice of vertue, and in the ſervice of God. The Laws of Religion do not abridge us of any pleaſure that a wiſe man can deſire, and ſafely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, I mean without a greater evil and trouble conſequent upon it. The pleaſure of commanding our appetites, and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our paſſions, by the rules of Reaſon (which are the Laws of God) is infinitely to be preferred before any ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure whatſoever: Becauſe it is the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of wifedom and diſcretion; and gives us the ſatisfaction of having done that which is beſt and fitteſt for reaſonable Creatures to do. Who would not rather chuſe to govern himſelf as <hi>Scipio</hi> did, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt all the temptations and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſenſual pleaſure which his power and victories preſented to him, than to wallow in all the delights of ſenſe?</p>
            <pb n="422" facs="tcp:59936:213"/>
            <p>Nothing is more certain in reaſon and experience, than that every inordinate appetite and affection is a puniſhment to it ſelf; and is perpetually croſſing its own pleaſure, and defeating its own ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by over-ſhooting the mark it aims at. For inſtance, <hi>Intemperance</hi> in eating and drinking, inſtead of delighting and ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature, doth but load and cloy it; and inſtead of quenching a natural thirſt, which it is extremely pleaſant to do, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates an unnatural one, which is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and endleſs. The pleaſure of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> as ſoon as it is executed, turns into grief and pity, guilt and remorſe, and a thouſand melancholy wiſhes that we had retrained our ſelves from ſo unreaſonable an Act. And the ſame is as evident in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſual exceſſes, not ſo fit to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcribed. We may truſt <hi>Epicurus</hi> for this, that there can be no true pleaſure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out temperance in the uſe of pleaſure. And God and Reaſon have ſet us no other bounds concerning the uſe of ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, but that we take care not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to our ſelves, or others, in the kind, or degree of them. And it is very viſible, that all ſenſual exceſs is naturally attended with a double inconvenience: As it goes beyond the limits of nature,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:59936:213"/>it begets bodily pains and diſeaſes: As it tranſgreſſeth the rules of Reaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it breeds guilt and remorſe in the mind. And theſe are, beyond compariſon, the two greateſt evils in this world: a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed body, and a diſcontented mind, And in this I am ſure I ſpeak to the inward feeling and experience of men; and ſay nothing but what every vicious man finds, and hath a more lively ſenſe of, than is to be expreſſed by words.</p>
            <p>When all is done, there is no pleaſure comparable to that of Innocency, and freedom from the ſtings of a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: This is a pure and ſpiritual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, much above any ſenſual delight. And yet among all the delights of ſenſe, that of health (which is the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of a ſober, and cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular life) is a ſenſual pleaſure far beyond that of any Vice: For it is the life of life; and that which gives a gratefull reliſh to all our other enjoyments. It is not indeed ſo violent and tranſporting a pleaſure, but it is pure, and even, and laſting, and hath no guilt and regret, no ſorrow and trouble in it, or after it: which is a worm that infallibly breeds in all vicious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull pleaſures, and makes them to be bitterneſs in the end.</p>
            <p>All the ways of ſin are ſo beſet with
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:59936:214"/>thorns and difficulties on every ſide, there are ſo many unanſwerable objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Vice, from the unreaſonableneſs and uglineſs of it, from the remorſe that attends it, from the endleſs miſery that follows it, that none but the raſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate can obtain leave of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to commit it. It is the Daughter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency, and blindneſs, and folly; and the Mother of guilt, and repentance, and woe. There is no pleaſure that will hold out and abide with us to the laſt, but that of Innocency and well-doing. All ſin is folly; and as <hi>Seneca</hi> truly ſays, <hi>omnis ſtultitia laborat faſtidio ſui; all folly ſoon grows ſick and weary of it ſelf.</hi> The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it is ſlight and ſuperficial, but the trouble and remorſe of it pierceth our very hearts.</p>
            <p>And then as to the other part of the Objection, <hi>That Religion reſtrains us of our liberty:</hi> The contrary is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently true, that ſin and vice are the greateſt ſlavery. For he is truly a ſlave, who is not at liberty to follow his own judgment, and to do thoſe things which he is inwardly convinced it is beſt for him to do: but is ſubject to the unreaſonable commands, and the tyrannical power and violence of his luſts and paſſions: So that he is not maſter of himſelf, but other
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:59936:214"/>Lords have got dominion over him, and he is perfectly at their beck and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. One vice or paſſion bids him go, and he goes; another come, and he comes; and a third, do this, and he doth it. The man is at perpetual vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with his own mind, and continually committing the things which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns in himſelf. And it is all one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man be ſubject to the will and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of another perſon, or to his own luſts and paſſions. Only this of the two is the worſe; becauſe the Tyrant is at home, and always ready at hand to domineer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him: he is got within him, and ſo much the harder to be vanquiſhed and overcome.</p>
            <p>But the ſervice of God, and obedience to his Laws is perfect liberty. Becauſe the Law of God requires nothing of us, but what is recommended to us by our own reaſon and from the benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of doing it: nothing but what is much more for our own intereſt to do it, than it can be for God's to command it. And if in ſome things God exact obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of us more indiſpenſibly, and under ſeverer penalties, it is becauſe thoſe things are in their Nature more neceſſary to our felicity. And how could God poſſibly have dealt more graciouſly and kindly
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:59936:215"/>with us, than to oblige us moſt ſtrictly to that which is moſt evidently for our good: and to make ſuch Laws for us, as if we live in obedience to them will infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly make us happy. So that taking all things into conſideration, the intereſt of our bodies and our ſouls, of the preſent and the future, of this world and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Religion is the moſt reaſonable and wiſe, the moſt comfortable and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious courſe that any man can take in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his own happineſs.</p>
            <p>The conſideration whereof ought to be a mighty endearment of our duty to us, and a moſt prevalent argument with us to yield a ready and chearfull obedience to the Laws of God; which are in truth ſo many acts of grace and favour to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the real privileges of our nature, and the proper means and cauſes of our happineſs: And do reſtrain us from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but from doing miſchief to our ſelves, from playing the fools and making our ſelves miſerable.</p>
            <p>And therefore inſtead of oppoſing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, upon pretence of the unreaſonable reſtraints of it, we ought to thank God heartily, that he hath laid ſo ſtrict an obligation upon us to regard and purſue our true intereſt; and hath been pleaſed
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:59936:215"/>to take that care of us, as to ſet bounds to our looſe and wild appetites by our duty; and in giving us rules to live by, hath no ways complyed with our inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and fooliſh inclinations, to our real harm and prejudice: But hath made thoſe things neceſſary for us to do, which in all reſpects are beſt for us; and which, if we were perfectly left to our own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ought in all reaſon to be our free and firſt choice: And hath made the folly and inconvenience of ſin ſo groſly palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that every man may ſee it before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand that will but conſider, and at the beginning of a bad courſe look to the end of it: and they that will not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſhall be forced from wofull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at laſt to acknowledge it, when they find the diſmal effects and miſchievous conſequences of their vices ſtill meeting them at one turn or other.</p>
            <p>And now, by all that hath been ſaid upon this Argument, I hope we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that Religion is no ſuch intolerable yoke; and that upon a due and full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of things it cannot <hi>ſeem evil</hi> unto any of us <hi>to ſerve the Lord:</hi> nay, on the contrary, that it is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, both to our preſent peace and our future felicity: And that a religious
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:59936:216"/>and vertuous life is not only upon all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the moſt prudent, but after we are entred upon it, and accuſtomed to it, the moſt pleaſant courſe that any man can take: and however inconſiderate men may complain of the reſtraints of Religion that it is not one jot more our duty, than it is our privilege and our happineſs.</p>
            <p>And I cannot think that upon ſober conſideration any man could ſee reaſon to thank God to be releaſed from any of his Laws, or to have had the contrary to them enjoyned. Let us ſuppoſe, that the Laws of God had been juſt the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe</hi> of what they now are; that he had commanded us, under ſevere penalties, to deal falſly and fraudulently with our neighbour; to demean our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully to our beſt friends and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors; to be drunk every day, and to purſue ſenſual pleaſures to the endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our health and life: How ſhould we have complained of the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe Laws, and have murmured at the ſlavery of ſuch intolerable impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions? And yet now that God hath commanded us the contrary, things eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way agreeable to our reaſon and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, we are not pleaſed neither. What will content us? As our Saviour expoſtulates in
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:59936:216"/>a like caſe, <hi>whereunto ſhall I liken this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? It is like unto Children playing in the Market-place, and calling unto their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, we have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned, and ye have not lamented.</hi> This is perfectly childiſh, to be pleaſed with nothing; neither to like this, nor the contrary. We are not contented with the Laws of God as they are, and yet the contrary to them we ſhould have eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the greateſt grievance in the World.</p>
            <p>And if this be true that the Laws of God, how contrary ſoever to our vicious inclinations, are really calculated for our benefit and advantage, it would almoſt be an affront to wiſe and conſiderate men to importune them to their intereſt; and with great earneſtneſs to perſuade them to that which in all reſpects is ſo viſibly for their advantage. <hi>Chuſe you</hi> therefore <hi>this day whom you will ſerve;</hi> God, or your luſts. And take up a ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in a matter of ſo great and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a concernment; chuſe you <hi>this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where there is great hazard in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a thing, it is good to deliberate long before we undertake it: but where the thing is not only ſafe but beneficial, and not only hugely beneficial but highly neceſſary; when our life and our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:59936:217"/>depends upon it, and all the danger lies in the delay of it; there we cannot be too ſudden in our reſolution, nor too ſpeedy in the execution of it. That which is evidently ſafe, needs no delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and that which is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, will admit of none.</p>
            <p>Therefore reſolve upon it out of hand; <hi>to day, whileſt it is called to day, leſt d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you be hardened through the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of ſin.</hi> In the days of your youth and health; for <hi>that is the acceptable time,</hi> that is <hi>the day of ſalvation:</hi> Before <hi>the evil day comes,</hi> and you be driven to it by the terrible apprehenſion and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of death, when men fly to God only for fear of his wrath. For the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Atheiſts and Infidels, when they come to dye (if they have any of that reaſon left, which they have uſed ſo ill) have commonly right opinions about God and Religion. For then the conſidence as well as the comfort of Atheiſm leaves them, as the Devil uſes to do Witches when they are in diſtreſs. Then with <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> when they are recovered from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaſts, they look up to heaven and their understanding returns to them: Then they believe a God, and cannot help it: they believe, and tremble at the
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:59936:217"/>thoughts of him. Thus <hi>Lucretius,</hi> one of their <hi>great Authors,</hi> obſerves, that when men are in diſtreſs,
<q>Acrius advertunt animos ad Religionem,</q>
            </p>
            <p>The thoughts of Religion are then more quick and pungent upon their minds,
<q>
                  <l>Nam verae voces tum demum pectore ab imo</l>
                  <l>Eliciuntur, &amp; eripitur perſona, manet res.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Mens words then come from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of their hearts; the mask is taken off, and things then appear as in truth they are.</p>
            <p>But then perhaps it may be too late to make this choice: Nay then it can hardly be choice, but neceſſity. Men do not then chuſe to ſerve the Lord, but they are urged and forced to it by their fears. They have ſerved their luſts all their life long, and now they would fain ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of God at the hour of death. They have done what they can, by their inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent contempt and defiance of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to make themſelves miſerable; and now that they can ſtand out no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, they are contented at laſt to be beholding to him to make them happy. The mercies of God are vaſt and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:59936:218"/>but yet methinks it is too great a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in all reaſon, for men to deſign before-hand to make the mercy of God the ſanctuary and retreat of a ſinfull life.</p>
            <p>To draw then to a Concluſion of this Diſcourſe. If ſafety, or pleaſure, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, or wiſdom, or vertue, or even happineſs it ſelf have any temptation in them, Religion hath all theſe baits and allurements. What <hi>Tully</hi> ſays <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> is much more true of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> the Wiſdom and Philoſophy which is from above; <hi>nunquam ſatis lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dari poterit, cui qui pareat, omne tempus aeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ſine moleſtia degere poſſit. We can never praiſe it enough, ſince whoever lives accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of it, may paſs the whole age of his life</hi> (I may add, his whole durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this life and the other) <hi>without trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philoſophy</hi> hath given us ſeveral plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rules for the attaining of peace and tranquility of mind, but they fall very much ſhort of bringing men to it. The very beſt of them fail us upon the greateſt occaſions. But the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> hath effectually done all that which <hi>Philoſophy</hi> pretended to, and aimed at. The Precepts and Promiſes of the Holy Scriptures are every way ſufficient for our comfort, and for our inſtruction in
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:59936:218"/>righteouſneſs: to correct all the errours, and to bear us up under all the evils and adverſities of humane life: eſpecially that holy and heavenly Doctrine which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the admirable <hi>Sermons</hi> of our <hi>Saviour, quem cum legimus, quem Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phum non contemnimus?</hi> whoſe excellent diſcourſes when we reade, what Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher do we not deſpiſe? None of the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> could, upon ſure grounds, give that encouragement to their <hi>Scholars</hi> which our <hi>Saviour</hi> does to his <hi>Diſciples; take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, and ye ſhall find reſt to your ſouls. For my yoke is eaſie, and my burthen is light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the advantage of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> ſincerely believed and practiſed, that it gives perfect reſt and tranquillity to the mind of man: It frees us from the guilt of an evil conſcience, and from the power of our luſts, and from the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh fear of death and of the vengeance of another World. It builds our comfort upon a rock, which will abide all ſtorms, and remain unſhaken in every condition, and will laſt and hold out for ever: <hi>He that heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them</hi> (ſaith our <hi>Lord</hi>) <hi>I will liken him to a wiſe wan, who built his houſe upon a rock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, Religion makes the life of
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:59936:219"/>man a wiſe deſign, regular and conſtant to its ſelf; becauſe it unites all our reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and actions in one great end: Whereas without Religion the life of man is a wild, and fluttering, and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent thing, without any certain ſcope and deſign. The vicious man lives at randome, and acts by chance: For he that walks by no rule can carry on no ſettled and ſteady deſign. It would pity a man's heart to ſee, how hard ſuch men are put to it for diverſion, and what a burden time is to them; and how ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous they are to deviſe ways, not to ſpend it but to ſquander it away. For their great grievance is conſideration, and to be obliged to be intent upon any thing that is ſerious. They hurry from one vanity and folly to another; and plunge themſelves into drink, not to quench their thirſt, but their guilt: and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to every vain man, and to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trifling occaſion, that can but help to take time off their hands. Wretched and inconſiderate men! who have ſo vaſt a work before them, the happineſs of all eternity to take care of and provide for, and yet are at a loſs how to employ their time! So that Irreligion and Vice makes life an extravagant and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:59936:219"/>thing, becauſe it perverts and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the natural courſe and order of things. For inſtance; according to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture men labour to get an Eſtate, to free themſelves from temptations to rapine and injury; and that they may have wherewithall to ſupply their own wants, and to relieve the needs of others. But now the covetous man heaps up Riches, not to enjoy them, but to have them; and ſtarves himſelf in the midſt of plenty, and moſt unnaturally cheats and robbs himſelf of that which is his own; and makes a hard ſhift to be as poor and miſerable with a great Eſtate, as any man can be without it. According to the deſign of nature, men ſhould eat and drink that they may live; but the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous man onely lives that he may eat and drink. Nature in all ſenſual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments deſigns pleaſure, which may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be had within the limits of vertue: But vice raſhly purſues pleaſure into the enemies quarters; and never ſtops, till the ſinner be ſurrounded and ſeized upon by pain and torment.</p>
            <p>So that take away God and Religion, and men live to no purpoſe; without propoſing any worthy and conſiderable end of life to themſelves. Whereas the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:59936:220"/>fear of God, and the care of our immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls, fixeth us upon one great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, to which our whole life, and all the actions of it are ultimately referr'd, <hi>ubi unus Deus colitur</hi> (ſaith <hi>Lactantius</hi>) <hi>ibi vita, &amp; omnis actus, ad unum caput, &amp; ad unam ſummam refertur;</hi> when we acknowledge God as the Author of our Being, as our Sovereign, and our Judge, our end and our happineſs is then fixed; and we can have but one reaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and that is, by endeavouring to pleaſe God to gain his favour and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this World, and to arrive at the bliſsfull enjoyment of him in the other: <hi>In whoſe preſence is fullneſs of Joy; and at whoſe right hand are pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> To Him, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, be all honour and glory, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and power, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>COnſidering the great difficulty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming thoſe who are far gone in an evil courſe, it is no more than needs to uſe all ſorts of Arguments to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: From the conſideration of the evil of ſin, and of the goodneſs of God and his wonderfull patience and long-ſuffering towards us in the midſt of our infinite Provocations: From his great mercy and pity declared to us in all thoſe gratious means and methods which he uſeth for our recovery: And from his readineſs and forwardness after all our Rebellions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us upon our repentance, and to be perfectly reconciled to us as if we had never offended him: And from the final
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:59936:221"/>iſſue and event of a wicked life, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and endleſs miſeries of another World, into which we ſhall inevitably fall except we repent in time and return to a better mind: And laſtly, from the danger of being hardened in an evil courſe, paſt all remedy and hopes of Repentance.</p>
            <p>And yet I am very ſenſible that to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Men of the impoſſibility, or at leaſt the extreme difficulty, of reſcuing temſelves out of this miſerable ſtate ſeems to be an odd and croſs kind of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and more apt to drive people to deſpair than to gain them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>But ſince the Spirit of God is pleaſed to make uſe of it to this purpoſe, we may ſafely rely upon infinite Wiſedom for the fitneſs of it to awaken ſinners to a ſenſe of their condition, in order to their recovery. For here in the Text, after terrible threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Captivity and deſolation to the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were extremely wicked and degenerate, thorough an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal depravation of manners in all ranks of men from the higheſt to the loweſt, ſo that they ſeemed to ſtand upon the brink of ruine, and to be fatally devoted to it; to add to the terrour and force of theſe threatnings, God by his Prophet repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:59936:221"/>to them the infinite danger and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme difficulty of their caſe, to ſee if he could ſtartle them by telling them into what a deſperate condition they had plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themſelves; being by a long cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>om of ſinning ſo far engaged in an evil courſe, that they had almoſt cut off themſelves from a poſſibility of retreat; ſo that the difficulty of their change ſeemed next to a natural impoſſibility. <hi>Can the Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an change his Skin or the Leopard his Spots? then may ye alſo do good that are accuſtom'd to do evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Expreſſion is very high, and it is to be hoped ſomewhat Hyperbolical, and above the juſt meaning of the words. Which are, I think, only deſigned to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſie to us the extreme difficulty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this change; which is therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to a natural impoſſibility, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very near it, though not altogether up to it.</p>
            <p>And that this Expreſſion is thus to be mitigated, will appear more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by conſidering ſome other like paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Scripture. As, where our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our compares the difficulty of a rich Man's Salvation to that which is naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>a Camels paſſing thorough the eye of a Needle:</hi> Nay, he pitcheth
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:59936:222"/>his expreſſion higher, and doth not onely make it a thing of equal but of greater difficulty; <hi>I ſay unto you, it is eaſier for a Camel to go thorough the eye of a Needle, than for a rich man to enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> And yet when he comes to explain this to his Diſciples, he tells them that he onely meant that the thing was very difficult, <hi>how hard is it for thoſe that have riches to be ſaved?</hi> and that it was not abſolutely impoſſible, but ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king according to humane probability: <hi>with Men this is impoſſible, but not with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus alſo it is reaſonable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that ſevere paſſage of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>It is impoſſible for them that were once enlightened, if they fall away, to renew them again to Repentance. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,</hi> that is, it is very difficult.</p>
            <p>In like manner we are to underſtand this high Expreſſion in the Text, <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his Skin or the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard his Spots? then may ye alſo do good that are accuſtomed to do evil;</hi> that is, this moral change of men, ſettled and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in bad habits, is almoſt as difficult as the other.</p>
            <p>From the words thus explained <hi>two</hi> things will properly fall under our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>

            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The great difficulty of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vitious habits, or of changing a bad courſe, to thoſe who have been deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged in it and long accuſtomed to it. And this difficulty ariſeth, partly from the general nature of habits indiſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently conſidered whether they be good, or bad, or indifferent; partly, from the particular nature of evil and vitious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits; and partly, from the natural and judicial conſequences of a great progreſs and long continuance in an evil courſe.
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:59936:223"/>By the conſideration of theſe three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, the extreme difficulty of this change, together with the true cauſes and reaſons of it, will fully appear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we conſider the nature of all Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, whether good, or bad, or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. The cuſtom and frequent practice of any thing begets in us a facility and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in doing it. It bends the powers of our Soul, and turns the ſtream and current of our animal Spirits ſuch a way, and gives all our faculties a tendency and pliableneſs to ſuch a ſort of actions. And when we have long ſtood bent one way, we grow ſettled and confirmed in it; and cannot without great force and violence be reſtored to our former ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. For the perfection of any habit whether good, or bad, induceth a kind of neceſſity of acting accordingly. A rooted habit becomes a governing Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and bears almoſt an equal ſway in us with that which is natural. It is a kind of a new nature ſuperinduced, and even as hard to be expelled as ſome things which are Primitively and Originally natural. When we bend a thing at firſt it will endeavour to reſtore it ſelf; but it may be held bent ſo long till it will continue ſo of it ſelf and grow crooked; and then
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:59936:223"/>it may require more force and violence to reduce it to its former ſtreightneſs than we uſed to make it crooked at firſt. This is the nature of all habits, the farther we proceed the more we are confirmed in them: and that which at firſt we did vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, by degrees becomes ſo natural and neceſſary that it is almoſt impoſſible for us to do otherwiſe. This is plainly ſeen in the experience of every day, in things good and bad, both in leſſer and greater matters.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This difficulty ariſeth more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from the particular nature of evil and vitious habits. Theſe, becauſe they are ſuitable to our corrupt nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire with the inclinations of it, are likely to be of a much quicker growth and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, and in a ſhorter ſpace, and with leſs care and endeavour, to arrive at maturity and ſtrength, than the habits of grace and goodneſs. Conſidering the propenſion of our depraved nature, the progreſs of vertue and goodneſs is up the hill, in which we not onely move hardly and heavily, but are eaſily roll'd back: but by wickedneſs and vice we move down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; which, as it is much quicker and eaſier, ſo is it harder for us to ſtop in that courſe, and infinitely more difficult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from it.</p>
            <pb n="444" facs="tcp:59936:224"/>
            <p>Not but that at firſt a ſinner hath ſome conſiderable checks and reſtraints upon him, and meets with ſeveral rubs, and difficulties in his way; the ſhame and unreaſonableneſs of his vices, and the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diſquiet which they create to him: But he breaks looſe from theſe reſtraints, and gets over theſe difficulties by degrees: and the faſter and farther he advanceth in an evil courſe the leſs trouble ſtill they give him, till at laſt they almoſt quite loſe their force, and give him little or no diſturbance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shame</hi> alſo is a great reſtraint upon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at firſt, but that ſoon falls off: and when men have once loſt their innocence, their modeſty is not like to be long trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to them. For impudence comes on with vice, and grows up with it. Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervices do not baniſh all ſhame and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, but great and abominable crimes harden mens foreheads and make them ſhameleſs. <hi>Were they aſhamed</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Prophet</hi>) <hi>when they committed abomination? nay they were not aſhamed, neither could they bluſh.</hi> When men have the heart to do a very bad thing they ſeldom want the face to bear it out.</p>
            <pb n="445" facs="tcp:59936:224"/>
            <p>And as for the <hi>unreaſonableneſs</hi> of vice, though nothing in the World be more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to a free and impartial judgment, and the ſinner himſelf diſcerns it clearly enough at his firſt ſetting out in a wicked courſe.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Video meliora, probóque,</l>
               <l>Deteriora ſequor.</l>
            </q>
            <p>He offends againſt the light of his own mind, and does wickedly when he knows better: yet after he hath continued for ſome time in this courſe and is heartily engaged in it, his fooliſh heart is darken'd, and the notions of good and evil are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured and confounded, and things appear to him in a falſe and imperfect light: His luſts do at once blind and byaſs his underſtanding; and his judgment by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees goes over to his inclinations; and he cannot think that there ſhould be ſo much reaſon againſt thoſe things for which he hath ſo ſtrong an affection. He is now engaged in a Party, and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly concerned to maintain it, and to make the beſt of it: and to that end, he bends all his wits to advance ſuch princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as are fitteſt to juſtifie his wicked practices; and in all debates plainly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:59936:225"/>that ſide of the Queſtion which will give the greateſt countenance and encouragement to them. When men <hi>are corrupt and do abominable works,</hi> they <hi>ſay in their hearts there is no God,</hi> that is, they would fain think ſo. And every thing ſerves for an Argument to a willing mind; and every little objection appears ſtrong and conſiderable, which makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that which men are loath ſhould be true.</p>
            <p>Not that any man ever ſatisfied himſelf in the Principles of Infidelity, or was able to arrive to a ſteady and unſhaken per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of the truth of them, ſo as not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently to doubt and fear the contrary. However, by this means many men though they cannot fully comfort, yet they make a ſhift to cheat themſelves; to ſtill their Conſciences and lay them aſleep for a time, ſo as not to receive any great and frequent diſturbance in their courſe from the checks and rebukes of their own minds. And when theſe reſtraints are removed, the work of iniquity goes on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, being favoured both by wind and tide.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The difficulty of this change ariſeth likewiſe from the natural and judicial conſequences of a great progreſs and long
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:59936:225"/>continuance in an evil courſe. My mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that inveterate evil habits do partly from their own nature, and partly from the juſt judgment and permiſſion of God, put men under ſeveral diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of moving effectually towards their own recovery.</p>
            <p>By a long cuſtome of ſinning mens Conſciences grow brawny, and <hi>ſeared as it were with a hot iron;</hi> and by being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten trampled upon they become hard as the beaten road. So that unleſs it be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome extraordinary occaſion, they are ſeldom awakened to a ſenſe of their guilt. And when mens hearts are thus hard, the beſt counſels make but little impreſſion upon them. For they are ſteel'd againſt reproof, and impenetrable to good advice; which is therefore ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom offered to them, even by thoſe that wiſh them well, becauſe they know it to be both unacceptable, and unlikely to prevail. It requires a great deal of good nature in a very bad man, to be able patiently to bear to be told of his faults.</p>
            <p>Beſides, that habitual wickedneſs is naturally apt to baniſh conſideration, to weaken our reſolution, and to diſcourage our hopes both of God's grace and aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and of his mercy and forgiveneſs;
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:59936:226"/>which are the beſt means and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to repentance.</p>
            <p>Sin is a great enemy to <hi>Conſideration:</hi> and eſpecially when men are deeply plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into it, their condition is ſo very bad, that they are loth to think of it and to ſearch into it. A vitious man is a very deformed ſight, and to none more than to himſelf; and therefore he loves to turn his Eyes another way, and to divert them as much as he can from looking upon himſelf. He is afraid to be alone, leſt his own mind ſhould arreſt him, and his Conſcience ſhould take the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to call him to an account. And if at any time his own thoughts meet with him, and he cannot avoid conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he is ready to ſay as <hi>Ahab</hi> did to <hi>Elijah, haſt thou found me, O my enemy!</hi> and is as glad to ſhake it off as a man is to get rid of a Creditor, whom becauſe be knows not how to ſatisfie, he cares not to ſpeak with him. Conſideration is the great troubler and diſturber of men in an evil courſe, becauſe it would repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to them the plain truth of their caſe; and therefore they do all they can to keep it off, as thoſe who have improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently managed their affairs, and been ill husbands of their eſtates, are loth to
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:59936:226"/>make up their accounts, leſt by that means they ſhould be forced to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the worſt of their condition.</p>
            <p>Or if conſideration happen to take them at an advantage, and they are ſo hard preſt by it that they cannot eſcape the ſight of their own condition, yet they find themſelves ſo miſerably entangled and hamper'd in an evil courſe, and bound ſo faſt in the chains of their own wickedneſs, that they know not how to get looſe. Sin is the ſaddeſt ſlavery in the World; it breaks and ſinks mens Spirits, and makes them ſo baſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile that they have not the courage to reſcue themſelves. No ſort of ſlaves are ſo poor ſpirited as they that are in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to their luſts. Their power is gone, or if they have any left they have not the heart to make uſe of it. And though they ſee and feel their miſery, yet they chuſe rather to ſit down in it, and tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſubmit to it, than to make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute attempt for their Liberty. What the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſays of <hi>whoredom</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> is proportionably true of other vices, <hi>they take away the heart.</hi> Every luſt that we entertain deals with us as <hi>Dalilah</hi> did with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> not only robbs us of our ſtrength but leaves us faſt bound: ſo that if at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:59936:227"/>time we be awakened to a ſenſe of our condition, and try to reſcue our ſelves from it, we find that <hi>our ſtrength is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from us,</hi> and that we are not able to break looſe.</p>
            <p>And as long cuſtom and continuance in ſin deprives us of our ſtrength, ſo it diſcourageth our hopes, both of God's grace and aſſiſtance, and of his mercy and forgiveneſs. For why ſhould men expect the continuance of that grace which they have ſo often received in vain? After ſo many provocations, how can we look the offended Majeſty of God in the Face? how can we lift up our eyes to heaven with any hopes of mercy and forgiveneſs there? Deſpair doth almoſt naturally ſpring from an evil Conſcience: and when men are thoroughly awakened to a ſenſe of ſin, and of the infinite evil of it, as they cannot eaſily forgive themſelves, ſo they can hardly believe that there is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs enough any where to forgive them.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe diſadvantages, which are natural and conſequent upon a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious courſe; by the juſt judgment of God, his Spirit is withdrawn from them, and they are given up to their own hearts luſts, to commit all iniquity with greedineſs. And then there is hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:59936:227"/>thing left, ether to reſtrain them in their evil courſe, or to recover them out of it.</p>
            <p>And not only ſo, but by the juſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of God, as men grow worſe and more wicked, the Devil hath a nearer acceſs to them and a more immediate power over them. So the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us, that wicked men are <hi>led captive by Satan at his pleaſure,</hi> and that the <hi>evil one works</hi> and acts <hi>in the Children of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience:</hi> They are as it were poſſeſt and inſpired by him. And what can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from this cruel and malicious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of mankind, but that he will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually be puniſhing them on from one wickedneſs to another, till he drive them firſt into deſpair, and then, if God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him, into eternal perdition?</p>
            <p>And what a forlorn ſtate is this? when men are thus forſaken of God, and left without check, blindly and headily to follow the ſway of their own tempers, and the bent of their own corrupt hearts? when they are continually expoſed to temptations ſtrongly inviting them to evil; and God lets the Devil looſe upon them to manage thoſe temptations with his utmoſt skill, and to practiſe all his arts and wiles upon them? In theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:59936:228"/>men almoſt infallibly run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin, as ſure as men wander in the dark, and are in danger of falling in ſlippery places, and of being entangled when they continually walk in the midſt of ſnares cunningly laid for them. It is not in men thus diſabled and entangled, to order their own ſteps, and to reſtrain their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and paſſions in the preſence of a powerfull temptation. At the beſt, we need God's direction to guide us, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual grace to uphold us, and to guard and preſerve us from evil; and much more do we ſtand in need of it, when we have brought our ſelves into theſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed circumſtances; but then alas! how little reaſon have we to hope for it?</p>
            <p>Blind and miſerable men! that in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite of all the mercifull warnings of God's word and providence, will run themſelves into this deſperate ſtate, and never think of returning to a better mind, till their retreat is difficult almoſt to an impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. Head of my Diſcourſe, which was to ſhew that the caſe of theſe perſons, though it be extremely difficult, is not quite deſperate; but after all, there is ſome ground of hope and encouragement
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:59936:228"/>left that they may yet be reclaimed and brought to goodneſs. Indeed humanely ſpeaking, and according to all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and probability, the thing ſeems to be very hopeleſs, and next to an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility; but yet what our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſays concerning the difficulty of a rich man's Salvation will reach alſo to this caſe, though much more difficult; <hi>thoſe things which are impoſſible with men are poſſible with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this will appear, if we conſider that even in the worſt of men there is ſomething left which tends to reclaim them, to awaken them to conſideration, and to urge and encourage them to a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous reſolution of a better courſe: And this accompanied with a powerfull aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of God's grace, which when ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely ſought is never to be deſpaired of, may prove effectual to bring back even the greateſt of ſinners.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is left, even in the worſt of men, a natural ſenſe of the evil and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of ſin; which can hardly be ever totally extinguiſhed in humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For though the habits of great vices are very apt to harden and ſtupifie men, ſo that they have ſeldom a juſt ſenſe of their evil ways, yet theſe perſons are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:59936:229"/>under ſtrong convictions, and their conſciences do ſeverely check and rebuke them for their faults. They are alſo, by fits, under great apprehenſion of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their condition, and that the courſe which they are in, if they continue in it, will prove fatal to them, and ruine them at laſt: Eſpecially, when their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are throughly awakened, by ſome great affliction, or the near approach of death and a lively ſenſe of another World. And the apprehenſion of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty danger will make men to look about them, and to uſe the beſt means to avoid it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Very bad men when they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thoughts of becoming better are apt to conceive ſome good hopes of God's grace and mercy. For though they find all the cauſes and reaſons of deſpair in themſelves, yet the conſideration of the boundleſs goodneſs and compaſſions of God (how undeſerved ſoever on their part) is apt to kindle ſome ſparks of hope, even in the moſt deſponding mind. His wonderfull patience, in the midſt of our manifold provocations, cannot but be a good ſign to us, that he hath no mind that we ſhould periſh, but rather that we ſhould come to repentance; and
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:59936:229"/>if we do repent, we are aſſured by his promiſe, that we ſhall be forgiven. <hi>He that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſins ſhall have mercy. If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſins and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Who knows what men throughly rouzed and ſtartled may reſolve, and do? And a mighty reſolution will break through difficulties which ſeem inſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Though we be weak and pitifull Creatures; yet nature when it is mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly irritated and ſtir'd will do ſtrange things. The reſolutions of men upon the brink of deſpair, have been of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible force: and the Soul of man in nothing more diſcovers its divine power and original, than in that ſpring which is in it whereby it recovers it ſelf when it is mightily urged and preſt. There is a ſort of reſolution which is in a manner invincible, and hardly any difficulty can reſiſt it or ſtand before it.</p>
            <p>Of this there have been great inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in ſeveral kinds. Some by an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate reſolution, and taking incredible pains with themſelves, have maſtered great natural vices and defects. As <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> who almoſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all mankind in thoſe two things
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:59936:230"/>for which by nature they ſeemed to be leaſt made, and moſt unfit. One, in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of his paſſions, and the other in the mighty force and power of his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>Some, that by intemperance have brought themſelves to a dropſie, which hath juſt ſet them upon the brink of the grave, by a bold and ſteady purpoſe to abſtain wholly from drink for a long time together, have reſcued themſelves from the jaws of death.</p>
            <p>Some that had almoſt ruined themſelves by a careleſs and diſſolute life, and having run themſelves out of their eſtates into debt, and being caſt into priſon, have there taken up a manly reſolution to retrieve and recover themſelves; and by the indefatigable labour and ſtudy of ſome years, in that uncomfortable retreat, have maſtered the knowledge and skill of one of the moſt difficult Profeſſions, in which they have afterwards proved great and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent.</p>
            <p>And ſome, in the full carriere of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courſe, have by a ſudden thought and reſolution, raiſed in them and aſſiſted by a mighty grace of God, taken up pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently and made an immediate change from great wickedneſs and impiety of life
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:59936:230"/>to a very exemplary degree of goodneſs and vertue.</p>
            <p>The two great encouragements to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> gave to his Scholars were theſe; and they were worthy of ſo great a Philoſopher; <hi>Firſt, Chuſe always the beſt courſe of life, and cuſtome will ſoon make it the moſt pleaſant.</hi> The <hi>other</hi> was this, that <hi>Power aad Neceſſity are Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi> and <hi>never dwell far from one another.</hi> When men are preſt by a great neceſſity, when nature is ſpurr'd up and urged to the utmoſt, men diſcover in themſelves a power which they thought they had not, and find at laſt that they can do that which at firſt they deſpaired of ever being able to do.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The grace and aſſiſtance of God when ſincerely ſought, is never to be deſpaired of. So that if we do but hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily and in good earneſt reſolve upon a better courſe and implore the help of God's grace to this purpoſe, no degree of it that is neceſſary ſhall be wanting to us. And here is our chief ground of hope. For we are <hi>weak and unſtable as water;</hi> and when we have taken up good reſolutions do eaſily ſtart from them. So that freſh ſupplies, and a continued aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of God's grace is neceſſary to keep
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:59936:231"/>up the firſt warmth and vigour of our reſolutions, till they prove effectual and victorious. And this grace God hath promiſed he will not deny to us, when we are thus diſpoſed for it; that he <hi>will give his H. Spirit to them that ask it;</hi> that <hi>he will hot quench the ſmoaking flax, nor break the bruiſed reed, untill he bring forth judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that now remains is to apply this to our ſelves: And we are all concerned in it: For we ſhall all find our ſelves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under one of theſe three Heads. Either we are of the number of thoſe few happy Perſons, who by the influence and advantage of a good education were never engaged in a bad courſe: Or of thoſe who have been drawn into vice, but are not yet far gone in it: Or, of thoſe who have been long accuſtomed to an evil courſe, and are grown old and ſtiff in it.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe having great cauſe to thank God for this ſingular felicity, that they were never enſnared and intangled in vitious habits, that they have not had the trial of their own weakneſs under this miſerable ſlavery, that they never knew what it was to be out of their own power, to have loſt their liberty and the
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:59936:231"/>Government of themſelves. When we hear of the miſerable ſervitude of the poor Chriſtians in <hi>Turkey</hi> we are apt, as there is great reaſon, to pity them, and to think what a bleſſing of God it is to us that we are not in their condition: And yet <hi>that</hi> ſlavery is hot comparable to <hi>this,</hi> either for the ſad nature, or the diſmal <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences</hi> of it; or for the difficulty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing releaſed from it. And let ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who have been thus happy never to have been engaged in an evil courſe, preſerve their innocency with great ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and care, as the greateſt Jewel in the World. No Man knows what he do's, and what a foundation of trouble he lays to himſelf, when he forfeits his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and breaks the peace of his own mind; when he yields to a Temptation, and makes the firſt ſtep into a bad courſe. He little thinks whither his luſts may hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him, and what a monſter they may make of him before they have done with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe who have been ſeduced, but are not yet deeply engaged in an evil courſe, let them make a ſpeedy retreat, leſt they put it for ever out of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to return. Perhaps their feet onely are yet enſnared, but their hands are at
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:59936:232"/>liberty, and they have ſome power left, whereby with an ordinary grace of God they may looſe and reſcue themſelves. But after a while their hands may be manacled, and all their power may be gone; and when they are thus <hi>bound hand and foot,</hi> they are juſt prepared, and in danger every moment, <hi>to be caſt into ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. As for thoſe, who are gone very far and are grown old in vice, who can forbear to lament over them? for they are a ſad ſpectacle indeed, and the trueſt object of pity in the World. And yet, <hi>their</hi> recovery is not utterly to be deſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of; for <hi>with God it is poſſible.</hi> The ſpirit of God, which hath withdrawn himſelf, or rather hath been driven away by them, may yet be perſuaded to return and to undertake them once more, if they would but ſeriouſly roſolve upon a change, and heartily beg God's aſſiſtance to that purpoſe. If we would take up a mighty reſolution, we might hope that God would afford a miraculous grace to ſecond it, and make it effectual to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. Even in this perverſe and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Age in which we live, God hath not been wanting to give ſome miraculous inſtances of his grace and mercy to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:59936:232"/>and thoſe perhaps equal to any of thoſe we meet with in Scripture, of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes,</hi> or <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> or the <hi>penitent Thief;</hi> both for the greatneſs of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, and the miracle of their change: To the end that none might deſpair, and for want of the encouragement of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample equal to their own caſe, be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned from ſo noble an enterprize. I am loth to put you in mind how bad ſome have been, who yet have been <hi>ſnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched as Firebrands out of the fire;</hi> and that in ſo ſtrange a manner, that it would even amaze a Man to think of the wonder of their recovery: thoſe who have ſunk themſelves into the very depth of infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and wickedneſs, have by a mighty hand and out-ſtretched arm of God been pluckt out of this horrible Pit. And will we ſtill ſtand it out with God, when ſuch great Leaders have given up the cauſe, and have ſurrendred and yielded up themſelves willing Captives to the grace of God? that omnipotent grace of God, which can eaſily ſubdue the ſtouteſt heart of Man, by letting in ſo ſtrong a light upon our minds, and pouring ſuch terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble convictions into our conſciences, that we can find no eaſe but in turning to God.</p>
            <pb n="462" facs="tcp:59936:233"/>
            <p>I hope there are none here ſo bad, as to need all the encouragement to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which ſuch examples might give them: encouragement I ſay to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: for ſurely theſe examples can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage no Man to venture any farther in a wicked courſe: they are ſo very rare, and like the inſtances of thoſe who have been brought back to life after the ſentence of death ſeemed to have been fully executed upon them.</p>
            <p>But perhaps ſome will not believe that there have been ſuch examples; or if there have, they impute all this either to a diſturbed imagination, or to the faint and low ſpirits of Men under great bodily weakneſs, or to their natural cowardize and fear; or to I know not what fooliſh and fantaſtical deſign of completing and finiſhing a wicked life with an hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal death. Nothing ſurely is eaſier than to put ſome bad conſtruction upon the beſt things, and ſo ſlurr even repentance it ſelf, and almoſt daſh it out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by ſome bold, and perhaps witty ſaying about it. But oh that Men were wiſe; oh that Men were wiſe! that they underſtood, and would conſider their lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end! Come, let us neither trifle, nor diſſemble in this matter; I dare ſay every
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:59936:233"/>man's Conſcience is convinced, that they who have led very ill lives have ſo much reaſon for repentance, that we may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe it to be real. However, of all things in the world, let us not make a mock of repentance; that which muſt be our laſt ſanctuary and refuge, and which we muſt all come to before we die, or <hi>it had been better for us we had never been born.</hi> Therefore, <hi>let my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel be acceptable unto you, break off your ſins by repentance,</hi> and <hi>your iniquities by righteouſneſs:</hi> And that inſtantly, and without delay; <hi>leſt any of you be hardned through the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi> If we have been enſlaved but a little to a vitious courſe, we ſhall find it a task difficult e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to aſſert our own liberty, to <hi>break theſe bonds in ſunder and to caſt theſe cords from us:</hi> But if we have been long under this bondage, we have done ſo much to undoe our ſelves, and to make our caſe deſperate, that it is God's infinite mercy to us that there is yet hope. Therefore, <hi>give glory to the Lord your God, before he cauſe darkneſs, and your feet ſtumble upon the dark mountains, and while you look for light, he turn it into darkneſs and the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death.</hi> I will conclude with that encouraging invitation, even to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:59936:234"/>of ſinners, to repentance, from the mouth of God himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. <hi>Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your Soul ſhall live: ſeek the Lord while he may be found; and call upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to our God for he will abundantly pardon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To him let us apply, out ſelves, and humbly beſeech him, <hi>who is mighty to ſave,</hi> that he would ſtretch forth the right hand of his power for our deliverance, from this miſerable and cruel bondage of our luſts: and that <hi>as the rain cometh down from Heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it to bring forth and bud;</hi> ſo he would grant that <hi>his word may not return void, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his pleaſure, and proſper in the thing to which he ſent it;</hi> For his mercy ſake in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>To whom with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Holy Ghoſt, be all honour and glory now and for ever. Amen.</hi>

            <p>THE <hi>Scribes</hi> ſo often mentioned in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> were the great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors among the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and Interpreters of the Law of God. And becauſe many of them were of the Sect of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> which above all others pretended to skill and knowledge in the Law, therefore it is that our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Saviour</hi> do's ſo often put the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> together. And theſe were the men of chief Authority in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church; who equalled their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written word and traditions with the Law of God: Nay our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells us, <hi>they
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:59936:235"/>made the Commandments of God of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by their traditions.</hi> They did in effect aſſume to themſelves <hi>infallibility;</hi> and all that oppoſed and contradicted them they branded with the odious name of <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Againſt theſe our <hi>Saviour</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced this Woe here in the <hi>Text, Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites; for ye ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven againſt Men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>All the difficulty in the words is, what is here meant by <hi>ſhutting up the Kingdom of Heaven againſt Men:</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it more plainly, <hi>ye have taken away the key of knowledge, ye entred not in your ſelves, and them that were entring in, ye hindered.</hi> By putting theſe two expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions together we ſhall the more eaſily come at the meaning of the <hi>Text. Ye have taken away the key of knowledge,</hi> and <hi>have ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven againſt Men.</hi> This Metaphor of <hi>the key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> is undoubtedly an alluſion to that known cuſtome among the <hi>Jews</hi> in the admiſſion of their Doctors. For to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they gave Authority to interpret the Law and the Prophets, they were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly admitted into that office by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to them a <hi>Key</hi> and a <hi>Table-book.</hi> So that by the <hi>key of knowledge</hi> is here
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:59936:235"/>meant the interpretation and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures; and by <hi>taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the key of knowledge,</hi> not onely that they arrogated to themſelves alone the underſtanding of the Scriptures, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that they had conveyed away this key of knowledge, and as it were hid it out of the way, neither uſing it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as they ought, nor ſuffering others to make uſe of it.</p>
            <p>And thus they <hi>ſhut the Kingdom of Heaven againſt men;</hi> which is very fitly ſaid of thoſe who have locked the door againſt them that were going in, and have taken away the key. By all which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the plain meaning of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> in theſe Metaphorical expreſſions is, that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and Teachers of the Law, under a pretence of interpreting the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, had perverted them and kept the true knowledge of them from the People: Eſpecially thoſe Prophecies of the <hi>Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament</hi> which concerned the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And by this means the Kingdom of Heaven was ſhut againſt men: And they not only rejected the truth themſelves, but by keeping men in ignorance of the true meaning of the Scriptures, they hindered many from embracing our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and entering into the Kingdom of
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:59936:236"/>Heaven, who were otherwiſe well enough diſpoſed for it.</p>
            <p>Having thus explained the words, I ſhall from the main ſcope and deſign of them obſerve to you theſe two things.</p>

               <item>2. The great and inexcuſable fault of thoſe who deprive the People of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the holy Scriptures. They <hi>hut the kingdom of heaven againſt men,</hi> and do what in them lies to hinder their eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore our <hi>Saviour</hi> denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth ſo heavy a woe againſt them.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I ſhall ſpeak briefly to theſe two <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations;</hi> and then apply them to thoſe who are principally concerned in them.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I obſerve hence the Neceſſity of the knowledge of the holy Scriptures in order to our eternal Salvation. This is by our <hi>Saviour</hi> called <hi>the key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> that which lets men into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Knowledge is neceſſary to Religion: It is neceſſary to the Being of it; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the life and practice of it.
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:59936:236"/>
               <hi>Without Faith</hi> (ſays the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>) <hi>it is impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> Becauſe Faith is an act of the underſtanding, and do's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſuppoſe ſome knowledge and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of what we believe. To all acts of Religion there is neceſſarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome act of the Underſtanding; ſo that without knowledge there can be no devotion in the ſervice of God, no obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Laws. Religion begins in the Underſtanding, and from thence deſcends upon the heart and life. <hi>If ye know theſe things</hi> (ſays our <hi>Saviour</hi>) <hi>happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> We muſt firſt know God, before we can worſhip him; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what is his will, before we can do it.</p>
            <p>This is ſo very evident, that one would think there needed no diſcourſe about it. And yet there are ſome in the World that cry up Ignorance as the Mother of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And to ſhew that we do not wrong them in this, matter, Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth</hi> in his <hi>Dialogues</hi> (a <hi>Book</hi> in great vogue among the <hi>Papiſts</hi> here in <hi>England</hi>) does expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reckon up <hi>Ignorance</hi> among <hi>the Parents of Religion.</hi> And can any thing be ſaid more abſurdly and more to the diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Religion, than to derive the pedegree of the moſt excellent thing in
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:59936:237"/>the world from ſo obſcure and ignoble an Original; and to make that which the Scripture calls <hi>the beginning of wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>the excellency of knowledge,</hi> to be the Off-ſpring of Ignorance and a Child of darkneſs? Ignorance indeed may be the cauſe of wonder and admiration, and the mother of folly and ſuperſtition: But ſurely Religion is of a nobler Extraction, and is the iſſue and reſult of the beſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge; and deſcends from above, from the giver of every good and perfect gift, even the father of lights.</p>
            <p>And as knowledge in general is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Religion, ſo more particularly the knowledge of the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> is neceſſary to our eternal Salvation. Becauſe theſe are the great and ſtanding Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God to mankind; wherein the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, and his Will concerning our duty and the terms and conditions of our eternal happineſs in another World are fully and plainly declared to us.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures are the Word of God; and from whence can we learn the will of God ſo well as from his own mouth? They are the great inſtrument of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and ſhould not every man be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that which alone can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly inſtruct him what he muſt believe,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:59936:237"/>and what he muſt do that he may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? This is the teſtimony which the Scripture gives of it ſelf, that it is <hi>able to make, men wiſe unto ſalvation;</hi> And is it not very fit that every man ſhould have this wiſdom, and in order thereunto the free uſe of that <hi>Book</hi> from whence this wiſdom is to be learned?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I obſerve the great and inexcuſable fault of thoſe who keep men in Ignorance of Religion, and take away from them ſo excellent and neceſſary a means of divine knowledge as the <hi>H. Scriptures</hi> are. This our <hi>Saviour</hi> calls <hi>taking away the key of knowledge, and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Kingdom of Heaven againſt Men,</hi> That is, doing what in them lies to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it impoſſible for men to be ſaved. For this he denounceth a terrible <hi>Woe</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Teachers of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church: Though they did not proceed ſo far as to deprive men of the uſe of the <hi>H. Scriptures,</hi> but only of the right knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of them. This alone is a horrible impiety, to lead men into a falſe ſenſe and interpretation of Scripture, but much greater to forbid them the reading of it. This is to ſtop knowledge at the very Fountain-head; and not only to
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:59936:238"/>lead men into Errour, but to take away from them all poſſibility of rectifying their miſtakes. And can there be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſacrilege, than to rob men of the word of God, the beſt means in the world of acquainting them with the will of God and their duty, and the way to eternal happineſs? To keep the people in Ignorance of that which is neceſſary to ſave them, is <hi>to, judge them unworthy of eternal life,</hi> and to declare it do's not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them, and maliciouſly to contrive the eternal ruine and deſtruction of their Souls.</p>
            <p>To lock up the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and the <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God</hi> from the people in an unknown, tongue, what is this but in effect to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid men to know God and to ſerve him; to render them incapable of knowing what <hi>is the good and acceptable will of God;</hi> of joyning in his worſhip, or performing any part of it, or receiving any benefit or edification from it; And what is, if this be not, to ſhut the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt men? This is ſo outragious a cruelty to the ſouls of men, that it is not to be excuſed upon any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: This is to take the ſureſt and moſt effectual way in the world <hi>to deſtroy thoſe for whom Chriſt dyed,</hi> and directly to
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:59936:238"/>thwart the great deſign of God <hi>our Saviour, who would have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Men may miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

Beſides, this is to croſs the very end of the Scriptures, and the deſign of God in inſpiring men to write them. Can any man think that God ſhould ſend this great light of his Word into the world, for the Prieſts to <hi>hide it under a buſhel;</hi> and not rather that it ſhould be ſet up to the greateſt advantage for the enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the world? St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. That <hi>whatſoever things were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures might have hope.</hi> And 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>That all Scripture is given by inſpiration of God; and is proſitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs.</hi> And if the Scriptures were written for theſe ends, can any man have the face to pretend that they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:59936:239"/>the people as well as their teachers? Nay St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly tells the Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they were written for their learning, however it happens that they are not now permitted to make uſe of them. Are the <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſo uſefull and profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs? and why may they not be uſed by the people for thoſe ends for which they were given? 'Tis true indeed they are fit for the moſt knowing and learned, and ſufficient to make <hi>the man of God perfect, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed to every good work</hi> (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> there tells us.) But do's this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their being profitable alſo to the people; who may reaſonably be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſtand much more in need of all means and helps of inſtruction than their Teachers? And though there be many difficulties and obſcurities in the Scriptures, enough to exerciſe the skill and wit of the learned, yet are they not therefore either uſeleſs or dangerous to the People. The ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Church were of another mind. St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> tells us that, <q>Whatever things are neceſſary are manifeſt in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that all things are plain in the Scripture, which concern
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:59936:239"/>faith and a good life; and that thoſe things which are neceſſary to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of men, are not ſo hard to be come at, but that as to thoſe things which the Scripture plainly contains, it ſpeaks without diſguiſe like a familiar friend to the heart of the learned and unlearned.</q> And upon theſe and ſuch like conſiderations, the <hi>Fathers</hi> did every where in their <hi>Orations</hi> &amp; <hi>Homilies</hi> charge and exhort the people to be converſant in the holy Scriptures, to reade them daily and diligently and attentively. And I challenge our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> to ſhew me where any of the ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the people from reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, much leſs forbid them ſo to do. So that they who do it now have no Cloak for their ſin: And they who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo confidently to <hi>Antiquity</hi> in other caſes, are by the evidence of truth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to acknowledge that it is againſt them in this. Though they have ten thouſand <hi>Schoolmen</hi> on their ſide, yet have they not one <hi>Father,</hi> not the leaſt pretence of Scripture, or rag of antiquity to cover their nakedneſs in this point.</p>
            <p>With great reaſon then does our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> denounce ſo heavy a <hi>Woe</hi> againd ſuch teachers. Of old in the like caſe God
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:59936:240"/>by his <hi>Prophet</hi> ſeverely threatens the Prieſts of the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> for not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the people in the knowledge of God, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.6. <hi>My people are deſtroyed for lack of knowledge: becauſe thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected knowledge, I will alſo reject thee; thou ſhalt be no more a Prieſt to me: ſeeing thou haſt forgotten the Law of thy God, I will alſo forget thy Children.</hi> God, you ſee, lays the ruine of ſo many Souls at their doors, and will require their blood at their hands. So many as periſh for want of knowledge, and eternally miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry by being deprived of the neceſſary means of Salvation, their deſtruction ſhall be charged upon thoſe who <hi>have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the key of knowledge, and ſhut the kingdom of heaven againſt men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is juſt with God to puniſh ſuch perſons, not only as the occaſion, but as the Authours of their ruine. For who can judge otherwiſe, but that they who deprive men of the neceſſary means to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny end, do purpoſely deſign to hinder them of attaining that end? And whatever may be pretended in this caſe; to deprive men of the holy Scriptures, and to keep them ignorant of the ſervice of God, and yet while they do ſo, to make a ſhew of an earneſt deſire of their Salvation, is juſt
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:59936:240"/>ſuch a mockery, as if one of you that is a maſter ſhould tell his prentice how much you deſire he ſhould thrive in the world, and be a rich man, but all the while keeps him ignorant of his trade in order to his being rich; and with the ſtricteſt care imaginable conceals from him the beſt means of learning that whereby a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone he is likely to thrive and get aneſtate. <hi>Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By what hath been diſcourſed upon this Argument, you will eaſily perceive where the Application is like to fall. For the <hi>Woe</hi> denounced by our <hi>Saviour</hi> here in the <hi>Text</hi> againſt the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> falls every whit as heavy upon the <hi>Paſtours</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. They have taken away the key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with a witneſs; not only depriving the people of the right underſtanding of the Scriptures, but of the very uſe of them: As if they were ſo afraid they ſhould underſtand them, that they dare not ſuffer them ſo much as to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them.</p>
            <p>This Tyranny <hi>that</hi> Church hath exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed over thoſe of her Communion for ſeveral hundreds of years. It grew upon them indeed by degrees: For as by the
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:59936:241"/>inundation of <hi>Barbarous</hi> Nations upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire the <hi>Romans</hi> loſt their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage by degrees, ſo the Governours of that Church ſtill kept up the Scriptures and the ſervice of God in the <hi>Latin tongue;</hi> which at laſt was wholly unknown to the common people. And about the <hi>ninth</hi> and <hi>tenth Centuries,</hi> when by the general conſent of all their own <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> groſs darkneſs and ignorance covered this part of the world, the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> took away the <hi>key of knowledge,</hi> and did (as I may ſo ſay) put it under the door for ſeveral Ages; till the <hi>Reformation</hi> fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it out again, and rubbed off the ruſt of it.</p>
            <p>And I profeſs ſeriouſly that hardly any thing in the world, was ever to me more aſtoniſhing, than this uncharitable and cruel uſage of the people in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And I cannot tell which to wonder at moſt, the inſolence of their Governours in impoſing upon men this ſenſleſs way of ſerving of God, or the patience ſhall I call it, or rather ſtupidity of the people in enduring to be ſo into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably abuſed. Why ſhould reaſonable creatures be treated at this rude and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous rate? As if they were unworthy to be acquainted with the will of God;
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:59936:241"/>and as if that which every man ought to do, were not fit for every man to know: As if the common people had only Bodies to be preſent at the ſervice of God, but no Souls; or as if they were all diſtracted and out of their wits, and it were a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing to let in the light upon them.</p>
            <p>But to ſpeak more diſtinctly. There are <hi>two</hi> things we charge them withall, and which they are not able to deny. Their performing the publick <hi>ſervice of God</hi> in an unknown Tongue; and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the People of the uſe of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> And I ſhall firſt tell you what we have to ſay againſt theſe things, and then conſider what they pretend for them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As for their performing the ſervice of God in a tongue unknown to the People. And I begin with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who in his firſt <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> hath a whole <hi>Chapter</hi> on purpoſe to ſhew the unreaſonableneſs of this thing, and how contrary it is to the edification of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi> His diſcourſe is ſo plain and ſo well known, that I ſhall not particularly inſiſt: upon it. <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> in his <hi>Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> upon this <hi>Chapter,</hi> breaks out (as well he might) into admiration at the practice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in his
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:59936:242"/>time. <hi>Hâc in re mirum quam mutata ſit Eccleſiae conſuetudo:</hi> 
               <q>It is wonderfull (ſays he) how the cuſtom of the Church is altered in this matter. St. <hi>Paul had rather ſpeak five words with underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſo as to teach others, than ten thouſand in an unknown tongue.</hi> Why does the Church doubt to follow ſo great an Authority, or rather how dares ſhe to diſſent from it?</q>
            </p>
            <p>As for the practice of the ancient Church let <hi>Origen</hi> bear witneſs. <q>The <hi>Grecians</hi> (ſaith he) in their prayers uſe the <hi>Greek,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue; and ſo every one according to his Language prayeth unto God, and praiſeth him as he is able.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And not only in <hi>Origen</hi>'s time, but for more than the firſt ſix hundred years, the ſervice of God was always performed in a known Tongue. And this the learned men of their own Church do not deny. And Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> (as <hi>Caſſander</hi> tells us) ſaid it was much better this Cuſtom were reſtored; and being reproved for ſaying ſo, he ſaid he learned it from St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf confeſſeth that the <hi>Armenians, Egyptians, Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Ruſſians,</hi> and others do uſe their own Language in their Liturgies at this day.</p>
            <pb n="481" facs="tcp:59936:242"/>
            <p>But it is otherwiſe now in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and hath been for ſeveral Ages. And it ſeems they lay great ſtreſs upon it, not only as a thing or great Uſe, but Neceſſity. For Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII. forbids the Prince of <hi>Bohemia</hi> to permit to the People the celebration of divine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the <hi>Sclavonian</hi> Tongue; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him to oppoſe them herein with all his Forces. It ſeems he thought it a cauſe worthy the fighting for: and that it were much better the People ſhould be killed, than ſuffered to underſtand their prayers.</p>
            <p>But let us reaſon this matter a little calmly with them. Is it neceſſary for men to underſtand any thing they do in Religion? And is not Prayer one of the moſt ſolemn parts of Religion? and why then ſhould not men underſtand their Prayers as well as any thing elſe they do in Religion? Is it good that people ſhould underſtand their private Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? that (we thank them) they allow: and why not the publick as well? Is there leſs of Religion in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayers? is God leſs honoured by them? or are we not as capable of being edified and of having our hearts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections moved and excited by them? Where then lies the difference? The more
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:59936:243"/>I conſider it the more I am at a loſs what tolerable reaſon any man can give why people ſhould not underſtand their publick devotions as well as their private. If men cannot heartily and devoutly pray alone, without underſtanding what they ask of God, no more (ſay I) can they hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and devoutly join in the publick pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which are made by the Prieſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding what they are. If it be enough for the Prieſt to underſtand them, why ſhould not the Prieſt only be preſent at them? unleſs the people do not meet to worſhip God, but only to wait upon the Prieſt. But by ſaying the Prieſt underſtands them, it ſeems it is better ſome body ſhould underſtand them than not; and why is not that which is good for the Prieſt good for the people?</p>
            <p>So that the true ſtate of the <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi> is, whether it be fit that the people ſhould be edified in the ſervice of God; and whether it be fit the Church ſhould order things contrary to edification? For it is plain that the ſervice of God in an unknown tongue is uſeleſs and unprofitable to the People: Nay, it is evidently no publick ſervice of God, when the Prieſt only underſtands it. For how can they be ſaid to be <hi>publick prayers</hi> if the People do
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:59936:243"/>not join in them? and how can they join in that they do not underſtand? and to what purpoſe are <hi>Leſſons</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> read, if people are to learn nothing by them? and how ſhould they learn when they do not underſtand? This is as if one ſhould pretend to teach a man <hi>Greek,</hi> by reading him Lectures every day out of an <hi>Arabick</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Book, of which he underſtands not one ſyllable.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. As to their depriving rhe people of the uſe of the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> Our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Saviour</hi> exhorts the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>ſearch the Scriptures;</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth the Chriſtians that <hi>the word of God ſhould dwell richly in them;</hi> And the ancient <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> of the Church do moſt frequently and earneſtly recommend to the People the reading and ſtudy of the Scriptures: How comes the caſe now to be ſo alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? ſure the word of God is not changed; that certainly abides and continues the ſame for ever.</p>
            <p>I ſhall by and by examine what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends in excuſe of this Sacrilege. In the mean time I do not ſee what conſiderable Objections can be made againſt the People's reading of the Scriptures, which would not have held as well againſt the writing and publiſhing
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:59936:244"/>of them at firſt in a Language
underſtood by the People: As the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> was by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of the <hi>Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles</hi> by the <hi>Churches</hi> to whom they were written, and the <hi>Goſpels</hi> both by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks.</hi> Were there no difficulties and obſcurities then in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being wreſted by the unſtable and unlearned; were not people then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to errour, and was there no danger of Hereſie in thoſe Times? And yet theſe are their great Objections againſt putting the Scriptures into the hands of the people. Which is juſt like their arguing againſt giving the Cup to the Laity from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency of their <hi>beards,</hi> leſt ſome of the conſecrated wine ſhould be ſpilt upon them: As if <hi>errours</hi> and <hi>beards</hi> were inconveniencies lately ſprung up in the world, and which mankind were not lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>But if there were the ſame dangers and inconveniencies in all Ages, this Reaſon makes againſt the publiſhing of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to the people at firſt, as much as againſt permitting them the uſe of them now. And in truth all theſe objections are againſt the Scripture it ſelf: And that which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would find fault with if they durſt, is, that there ſhould be any ſuch <hi>Book</hi> in the world, and
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:59936:244"/>that it ſhould be in any bodies hands, learned or unlearned; for if it be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to any, none are ſo capable of doing miſchief with it as men of wit and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. So that at the bottom, if they would ſpeak out, the quarrel is againſt the Scriptures themſelves. This is too evident by the counſel given to Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the III. by the Biſhops met at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia</hi> to conſult about the eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Roman</hi> See: Where among other things they give this as their laſt advice, and as the greateſt and weightieſt of all, <hi>That by all means as little of the Goſpel as might be, eſpecially in the Vulgar Tongue, ſhould be read to the people; and</hi> that <hi>little which was in the</hi> Maſs <hi>ought to be ſufficient: neither ſhould it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to any mortal to read more. For ſo long</hi> (ſay they) <hi>as men were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with that little, all things went well with them; but quite otherwiſe, ſince more was commonly read.</hi> And ſpeaking of the Scripture, they give this remarkable teſtimony and commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it; <hi>this in ſhort is that Book which, above all others, hath raiſed thoſe tempeſts and whirlwinds which we were almoſt carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away with. And in truth, if any one diligently conſiders it, and compares it with
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:59936:245"/>what is done in our Church, he will find them very contrary to each other, and our Doctrine not only to be very different from it, but repugnant to it.</hi> If this be the caſe, they do like the reſt of the Children of this world, prudently enough in their Generation: Can we blame them for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Scriptures, when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are acknowledged to be ſo clearly againſt them? But ſurely no body that conſidereth theſe things would be of that <hi>Church,</hi> which is brought by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable evidence of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this ſhamefull confeſſion, <hi>that</hi> ſeveral of their Doctrines and Practices are very contrary to the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Much more might have been ſaid againſt the practice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in theſe two particulars, but this is ſufficient.</p>
            <p>I ſhall in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place conſider, what is pretended for them. And indeed what can be pretended in juſtification of ſo contumelious an affront to mankind, ſo great a Tyranny and cruelty to the Souls of men? hath God forbidden the People to look into the Scriptures? No; quite contrary. Was it the practice of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church to lay this reſtraint upon men; or to celebrate the ſervice of God in an unknown Tongue? our adverſaries
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:59936:245"/>themſelves have not the face to pretend this. I ſhall truly repreſent the ſubſtance of what they ſay in theſe <hi>two</hi> points.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I. As to the ſervice of God in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue they ſay theſe <hi>four</hi> things for themſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the people do exerciſe a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral devotion, and come with an intention to ſerve God; and that is accepted, though they do not particularly underſtand the prayers rhat are made, and the leſſons that are read.</p>
            <p>But is this all that is intended in the ſervice of God? do's not St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly require more? <hi>that</hi> the underſtanding of the people ſhould be edified by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſervice that is performed? And if what is done be not particularly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, he tells us the People are not edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, nor can ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to the prayers and thankſgivings that are put up to God; and that any man that ſhould come in and find people ſerving of God in this unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and unreaſonable manner would conclude that they were mad.</p>
            <p>And if there be any general devotion in the people, it is becauſe in general they underſtand what they are about; and why may they not as well underſtand the
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:59936:246"/>particular ſervice that is performed, that ſo they might exerciſe a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. So that they are devout no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they underſtand; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as to what they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, had every whit as good be abſent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They ſay, the prayers are to God, and he underſtands them; and that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. But what harm were it, if all they that pray underſtood them alſo: Or indeed how can men pray to God without underſtanding what they ask of him? Is not prayer a part of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an worſhip? and is not that a reaſonable ſervice? and is any ſervice reaſonable that is not directed by our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and accompanied with our hearts and affections?</p>
            <p>But then what ſay they to the <hi>Leſſons</hi> and Exhortations of Scripture, which are likewiſe read to the people in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue? Are theſe directed to God, or to the people only? And are they not deſigned by God for their inſtruction; and read either to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or to none? And is it poſſible to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct men by what they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand? This is a new and wonderfull way of teaching, by concealing from the people the things which they ſhould learn.
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:59936:246"/>Is it not all one, as to all purpoſes of edification, as if the Scriptures were not read, or any thing elſe in the place of them? as they many times do their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends, which the wiſer ſort among them do not believe when they read them. For all things are alike to them that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand none; as all things are of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in the dark. Ignorance knows no difference of things; it is only know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that can diſtinguiſh.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They ſay that ſome do, at leaſt in ſome meaſure, underſtand the particular prayers. If they do, that is no thanks to them. It is by accident if they are more knowing than the reſt; and more than the Church either deſires or intends. For if they deſired it, they might order their ſervice ſo, as every man might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They ſay that it is convenient that God ſhould be ſerved and worſhipped in the ſame Language all the world over. Convenient for whom: For <hi>God?</hi> or for the <hi>People?</hi> Not for <hi>God</hi> ſurely. For he underſtands all other Languages as well as <hi>Latin,</hi> and for any thing we know to the contrary likes them as well. And certainly it cannot be ſo convenient for the <hi>People</hi> becauſe they generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:59936:247"/>no Language but their own; and it is very inconvenient they ſhould not underſtand what they do in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God. But perhaps they mean that it is convenient for the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to have it ſo; becauſe this will look like an argument that they are the <hi>Catholick</hi> or univerſal Church, when the Language which was originally theirs ſhall be the univerſal Language in which all Nations ſhall ſerve God; and by this means alſo they may bring all Nations to be of their Religion, and yet make them never the wiſer; and this is a very great conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe knowledge is a troubleſome thing, and ignorance very quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, rendring men fit to be governed, and unfit to diſpute.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. As to their depriving the people of the Scriptures, the ſumm of what they ſay may be reduced to theſe <hi>three</hi> Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Church can give leave to men to read the Scriptures. But this not without great trouble and difficulty: there muſt be a Licence for it under the hand of the Biſhop or Inquiſitor, by the advice of the Prieſt or Confeſſor, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the fitneſs of the Perſon that deſires this privilege; And we may be ſure they
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:59936:247"/>will think none fit, but thoſe of whom they have the greateſt confidence and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity: And whoever preſumes to do it otherwiſe, is to be denied abſolution; which is, as much as in them lies, to damn men for preſuming to read the Word of God without their leave.</p>
            <p>And, whatever they may allow here in <hi>England,</hi> where they hold their people upon more ſlippery terms, yet this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege is very rarely granted where they are in full poſſeſſion of their power, and have the people perfectly under their Yoke.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They tell us they inſtruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple otherwiſe. This indeed were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing if they did it to purpoſe; but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they do it very ſparingly and ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Their Sermons are commonly made up of feigned ſtories and miracles of <hi>Saints,</hi> and exhortations to the worſhip of them (and eſpecially of the bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi>) and of their Images and Relicks. And for the truth of this I appeal to the innumerable Volumes of their <hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>Poſtils</hi> in print; which I ſuppoſe are none of their worſt. I am ſure <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſays that in his time in ſeveral Countries the people did ſcarce once in half a year hear a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Sermon to exhort them to true pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:59936:248"/>Indeed they allow the people ſome <hi>Catechiſms</hi> and <hi>Manuals</hi> of devotion; and yet in many of them they have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and the confidence to <hi>ſteal away the ſecond Commandment</hi> in the face of the <hi>eighth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, to bring the matter to a point, if thoſe helps of inſtruction are agreeable to the Scriptures, why are they ſo afraid the people ſhould read the Scriptures? if they are not, why do they deceive and delude them?</p>
            <p n="3">3. They ſay that people are apt to wreſt the Scriptures to their own deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that the promiſcuous uſe of them hath been the great occaſion of Hereſies. It cannot be denyed to be the condition of the very beſt things in the world, that they are liable to be abuſed: health and light and liberty, as well as knowledge. But muſt all theſe be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taken away? This very inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of peoples wreſting the Scriptures to their own ruine St. <hi>Peter</hi> takes notice of in his days; but he do's not therefore forbid men the reading of them, as his more prudent Succeſſours have done ſince. Suppoſe the reading of the Scriptures hath been the occaſion of Hereſies; were there ever more than in the firſt Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity;
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:59936:248"/>and yet neither the Apoſtles nor their Succeſſours ever preſcribed this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. But are they in earneſt? muſt not men know the truth for ſear of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into Errour? Becauſe men may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly miſs their way at noon-day, muſt they never travel but in the night, when they are ſure to loſe it?</p>
            <p>And when all is done, this is not true, that Hereſies have ſprung from this cauſe. They have generally been broached by the learned, from whom the Scriptures neither were, nor could be concealed. And for this I appeal to the Hiſtory and Experience of all Ages. I am well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ancient Fathers were of another mind. St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſays, <hi>if men would be converſant in the Scriptures, and attend to them, they would not only not fall into errours themſelves, but reſcue thoſe that are deceived:</hi> And that <hi>the Scriptures would inſtruct men both in right opinions and a good life.</hi> And St. <hi>Hierome</hi> more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly to our purpoſe. That <hi>infinite evils ariſe from the Ignorance of the Scriptures;</hi> and <hi>that from that cauſe the moſt part of Hereſies have come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if what they ſay were true, is not this to lay the blame of all the ancient Hereſies upon the ill management of things
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:59936:249"/>by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the holy <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Church for ſo many Ages, and their imprudent diſpenſing of the Scriptures to the people. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is to charge the matter home; and yet this conſequence is unavoidable. For the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot juſtifie the piety and prudence of their preſent prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, without accuſing all theſe.</p>
            <p>But the thing which they mainly rely upon as to both theſe practices is this. That though theſe things were otherwiſe in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> time, and in the <hi>Antient Church,</hi> yet the Church hath power to alter them according to the exigence and circumſtances of time. I have purpoſely reſerved this for the laſt place, becauſe it is their laſt refuge; and if this fail them they are gone.</p>
            <p>To ſhew the weakneſs of this pretence, we will, if they pleaſe, take it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Governours of the Church have in no Age more power, than the Apoſtles had in theirs. Now St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8. that the Authority which the Apoſtles had given them from the Lord was only <hi>for edification but not for deſtruction:</hi> And the ſame St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes it the buſineſs of a whole <hi>Chapter</hi> to ſhew that the performing the publick
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:59936:249"/>ſervice of God, and particularly Praying in an unknown Tongue, are contrary to edification; from which premiſſes the concluſion is plain, That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves had no Authority to appoint the ſervice of God to be performed in an unknown Tongue; and ſurely it is Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance for the Church in any Age to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to greater Authority than the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had.</p>
            <p>This is the ſumm of what our <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries</hi> ſay in juſtification of themſelves in theſe points. And there is no doubt, but that men of wit and confidence will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies make a ſhift to ſay ſomething for any thing; and ſome way or other blanch over the blackeſt and moſt abſurd things in the world. But I leave it to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mankind whether any thing be more unreaſonable than to tell men in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that it is fit they ſhould underſtand as little of Religion as is poſſible; that God hath publiſhed a very dangerous Book, with which it is not ſafe for the people to be familiarly acquainted; that our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and the ancient <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church for more than ſix hundred years were not wiſe managers of Religion, nor prudent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers of the Scriptures; but like fond
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:59936:250"/>and fooliſh Fathers put a knife and a ſword into the hands of their Children, with which they might eaſily have foreſeen what miſchief they would do to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others. And who would not chuſe to be of ſuch a Church which is provided of ſuch excellent and effectual means of Ignorance, ſuch wiſe and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible methods for the prevention of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the people, and ſuch variety of cloſe ſhutters to keep out the light?</p>
            <p>I have choſen to inſiſt upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe it is ſo very plain, that the moſt ordinary capacity may judge of this uſage and dealing with the ſouls of men: which is ſo very groſs that every man muſt needs be ſenſible of it; becauſe it toucheth men in the common rights of humane nature, which belong to them as much as the light of heaven, and the air we breath in.</p>
            <p>It requires no ſubtilty of wit, no skill in Antiquity, to underſtand theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies between Us and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For there are no <hi>Fathers</hi> to be pretended on both ſides in theſe Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: They yield we have Antiquity on ours: And we refer it to the common ſenſe of Mankind, which Church, that of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Ours,</hi> hath all the right and
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:59936:250"/>reaſon in the world on her ſide in theſe debates? And, who they are that tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over Chriſtians, the Governours of their Church or ours; who uſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple like ſons and freemen, and who like ſlaves; who feed the flock of Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, and who take the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens bread from them? Who they are that when their Children ask bread, for bread give them a ſtone, and for an egg a ſerpent; I mean the <hi>Legends</hi> of their <hi>Saints</hi> inſtead of the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which are able to make men wiſe unto ſalvation: And who they are that lie moſt juſtly under the ſuſpicion of Errours and Corruptions, they who bring their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and Practices into the open light, and are willing to have them tryed by the true touchſtone, the <hi>Word of God;</hi> or they who ſhun the light, and decline all manner of tryal and examination? and who are moſt likely to carry on a worldly deſign, they who drive a trade of ſuch mighty gain, and advantage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of Religion, and make ſuch markets of the ignorance and ſins of the people; or we whom malice it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not charge with ſerving any worldly deſign by any allowed Doctrine or Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our Religion? For we make no
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:59936:251"/>money of the miſtakes of the people, nor do we fill their heads with vain fears of new places of torment to make them willing to empty their purſes in a vainer hope of being delivered out of them. We do not like them pretend a mighty bank and treaſure of Merits in the Church, which they ſell to the people for ready money, giving them bills of Exchange from the <hi>Pope</hi> to <hi>Purgatory;</hi> when they who grant them, have no reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they will avail them, or be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the other World.</p>
            <p>For our parts we have no fear that our people ſhould underſtand Religion too well: We could wiſh, with <hi>Moſes, that all the Lord's people were Prophets:</hi> We ſhould be heartily glad the people would read the holy Scriptures more diligently, being ſufficiently aſſured that it is their own fault if they learn any thing but what is good from thence: We have no Doctrines or Practices contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and conſequently no occaſion to keep it cloſe from the ſight of the people, or to hide any of the Commandments of God from them: We leave theſe mean arts to thoſe who ſtand in need of them.</p>
            <p>In a word, there is nothing which God hath ſaid to men, which we deſire ſhould
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:59936:251"/>be concealed from them; Nay, we are willing the people ſhould examine what we teach, and bring all our Doctrines <hi>to the Law and to the Teſtimony;</hi> that if they be not according to <hi>this Rule,</hi> they may neither believe them nor us. 'Tis onely things, falſe and adulterate which ſhun the light and ſear the touchſtone. We have that ſecurity of the truth of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and of the agreeableneſs of it to the word of God; that honeſt confidence of the goodneſs of our Cauſe, that we do not forbid the people to read the beſt Books our Adverſaries can write againſt it.</p>
            <p>And now let any impartial man judge whether this be not a better argument of a good Cauſe, to leave men at liberty to try the grounds of their Religion, than the courſes which are taken in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to awe men with an <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> and, as much as is poſſible, to keep the common people in Ignorance, not onely of what their late Adverſaries, the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> but their chief and ancient Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, the <hi>Scriptures</hi> have to ſay againſt them.</p>
            <p>A man had need of more than common ſecurity of the skill and integrity of thoſe to whom he perfectly reſigns his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; this is too great a Truſt to be
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:59936:252"/>repoſed in humane frailty, and too ſtrong a temptation to others to impoſe upon us; to abuſe our blindneſs, and to make their own ends of our voluntary Ignorance and eaſie credulity. This is ſuch a folly as if a rich man ſhould make his Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an his heir; which is to tempt him either to deſtroy him or to let him die, for his own intereſt. So he that truſts the care of his ſoul with other men, and at the ſame time by <hi>irrevocable Deed</hi> ſettles his underſtanding upon them, lays too great a temptation before them to ſeduce and damn him for their own ends.</p>
            <p>And now to reflect a little upon our ſelves. What cauſe have we to bleſs God who are ſo happily reſcued from that more than <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſs and bondage, wherein this Nation was detained for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ages; who are delivered out of the hands of thoſe cruel task-maſters, who required brick without ſtraw; that men ſhould be religious without competent underſtanding, and work out their own ſalvation while they denyed them the means of all others the moſt neceſſary to it; who are ſo uncharitable as to allow us no ſalvation out of their Church, and yet ſo unreaſonable as to deny us the very beſt means of ſalvation when we are in it?</p>
            <pb n="501" facs="tcp:59936:252"/>
            <p>Our Fore-fathers thought it a mighty privilege to have the Word of God reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them, and the publick prayers and ſervice of God celebrated in a known Tongue: Let us uſe this ineſtimable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege with great modeſty and humility; not to the nouriſhing of pride and ſelf-conceit, of diviſion and faction; but as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> exhorts, <hi>Let the word of God dwell richly in you, in all wiſedom; and let the peace of God rule in your hearts, unto which ye are called in one body; and be ye thankfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It concerns us mightily (with which admonition I ſhall conclude) both for the honour, and ſupport of our Religion, to be at better union among our ſelves, and not to divide about leſſer things: and ſo to demean our ſelves, as to take from our Adverſaries all thoſe pretences whereby they would juſtifie themſelves, or at leaſt extenuate the guilt of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy charge, which falls every whit as juſtly upon them as ever it did upon the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> of <hi>taking away the key of knowledge, and ſhutting the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt men; neither going in themſelves, nor ſuffering thoſe that are entring to go in.</hi>
